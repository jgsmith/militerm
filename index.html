<p>Militerm is an open-source platform for building multi-player online text games
(MUD, MUX, MUSH, MUCK, and other MU*). You design your entire game using a
custom scripting language that can be extended with collections of functions
and entirely new game systems written in Elixir.</p>

<!-- <h2>What's Here</h2>

<p><em>Ramblings</em> is where we discuss general game design with an eye to the kind of
game we want to enable with Militerm. <em>Ideas</em> is a dumping ground for half-formed
thoughts that we don't want to lose. <em>Documentation</em> is where we describe the API.</p> -->

<h2>Where Can I Get It?</h2>

<p>Militerm's source code is hosted on Github. This is where you can download the
game and report bugs or ideas in the issue tracker.</p>

<!-- ## What Does It Look Like?

The following is an example transcript we're working towards. While this example
is simple, it illustrates what can be done in a single scene.

```
> look

You look around.

Old Seadog

You are standing behind the bar in the Old Seadog. The inn
radiates age and charm with its oak beam roof and many sea-
faring mementos secured firmly around the walls. Even the
bar is a single thick oak slab, worn and chipped with years
of service to rowdy sailors. An old glass window lets in a
little light from outside. A game room is to the south and
a parlor is to the southeast. A party room is at the bottom
of a flight of stairs.

A bottle of whiskey and an empty glass are on the bar.

Obvious exits: west

> quickly take the whiskey from the bar and then run down
  the stairs, "Ahhhhhhh!!!"

You grab the whiskey from the bar.
You run down the stairs into the party room, yelling
"Ahhhhhhh!!!"

Party Room

You are standing near the bottom of the stairs in the party
room. A banner hangs across with bright red letters on gold
foil. Glitter litters the floor below the banner. Off to one
side sits a table holding a few stale refreshments. Chairs
sit here and there.

> look at the table

You look at the table.

The table has a tray of cookies and a pitcher of warm sangria.

> take a cookie from the tray

You aren't near enough to the tray to reach it.

> move closer to the table

You walk towards the table.

> take a cookie from the tray

You take a cookie from the tray on the table.

> look

Party Room

You are standing near the table in the party room. A banner
hangs across with bright red letters on gold foil. Glitter
litters the floor below the banner. The table holds a few
stale refreshments. Chairs sit here and there. Across the
room, a set of stairs leads upwards.
