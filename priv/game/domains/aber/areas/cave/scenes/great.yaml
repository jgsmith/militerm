    sight: >
      You stand in the dwarven Great Hall, a huge carved room of spectacular design, with a massive
      fan-vaulted ceiling. The spectacular arches and pillars are all decorated with dwarvish battle scenes
      and, high up, dwarven momentos of great age are hung, golden banners, shining axes, helms, and many
      other items of war and craft. High arched exits lead north, east and south, a set of narrow stairs leads
      down into the cellars, and a wide sweeping staircase leads up to a high balcony overlooking the hall.
