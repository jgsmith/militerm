    short: Top Of West Tower
    sight: >
      You are in a small room at the top of the west tower. It looks out across a vast expanse of land. As
      your eyes wander across the skyline you can pick out the Desert of Fools, the valley and the black tower
      far in the distance. Clearly this is the dwarven watch post in times of war. Stone stairs lead down.
