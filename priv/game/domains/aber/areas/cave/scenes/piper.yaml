    sight: >
      You are standing in a small dry cave, with a low roof some six feet high. The cavemouth is to the north
      but is twisted enough that you cannot see out, and it also provides good shelter against the wind. To
      the south a narrow and low arched opening leads into another cave. The cave is clean and evidently well
      used by its occupant although who he is, its hard to tell.
