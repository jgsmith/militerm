      You are standing in the dwarven treasury. A large and very well protected room that few are privileged
      to see. A single door leads east. There is a charred shape on the wall, somewhat resembling an ex neccy
      Moog and scratched on the wall you see the words "Die Frog...the ex knight to be!". A second notice
      reads "Who's he?" and another asks "What's a Moog?"
