    sight: >
      The passageway leads further to the east and widens in the distance to some kind of cavern. You notice
      that the floor has become wet and you regret putting on sandals instead of the boots you had on when
      comming into this hot part of the world. The water on the floor seems to come from the cavern. To the
      north you see a low side tunnel.
