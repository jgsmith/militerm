    short: Beneath the Cross
    sight: >
      You stand beneath a huge &+Ycross&* wondering the reason of its' presence. It looks like it has been
      here more than thousand years - long before anyone knew anything of the Christian faith. From some
      strange markings on its' base you draw the conclusion that there might be one more cross like this
      somewhere in the town (what a detective!).
