    short: Stone Stairs
    sight: >
      You are going your way up the temple stairs sweating and panting. Breathing deeply you stop and lean
      against a statue besides the stairs. Examining the statue more closely, you figure out that the statue
      is actually a big head of a snake decorated with stony feathers. The snake has an evil grin on his face
      and you are glad it is not alive. The stairs lead upwards to the top of the temple and down back to the
      clearing.
