    short: Southern Side Tunnel
    sight: >
      The tunnel is widening as you move further to the south and seems to end in a small chamber just a few
      yards before you. The walls are glistening in the dim light coming from your torch. It looks like the
      rock around you would consist of various valuable minerals. Despite this splendid sight you feel quite
      uncomfortable and start feeling dizzy for some reason.
