    sight: >
      You have stepped into a small chamber, though you can't figure out the purpose of its' being. You see
      piles of used bandages in the corner and a couple of &+ybig pots&* made of clay placed near the northern
      wall. There's a stone platform in the middle of the room. This might have been some kind of a hospital
      or something. You hear a loud crack!
