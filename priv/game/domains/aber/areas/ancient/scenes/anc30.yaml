    short: Top of the Moon Pyramid
    sight: >
      You finally reach the top of the pyramid, understanding now the purpose of the physical training your
      friends used to keep in good condition. Before you, the moon shines brightly, appearing to be a gigantic
      wheel of cheese. You can imagine yourself taking a few steps ahead and grabbing a slice of that great
      big cheese. Before you on the floor there is a big cross- shaped figure. The carvings on the stone floor
      are telling tales about secret halls of ancient kings and holy men. You wonder where these mighty halls
      might be located, and you think that the &+Ycross&* has something to do with it.
