      The story of the pictures goes on as you enter a large hall that has exits to all directions. You find
      out that, not long before the town above you was abandoned, the astronomers found a new bright star in
      the sky. The star was thought to be a sign of destruction coming to the town. You can see more of these
      pictures leading to each direction.
