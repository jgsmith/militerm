      This small round shaped building has several little windows in all directions. The walls are covered
      with paintings and markings that leave you in ignorance of the higher sciences of the people who used to
      reign this ancient city. You understand, though, that this building has been used for observing the
      planets and stars. The planet Venus, seems to have had some significance to these people - maybe as a
      god or something like that.
