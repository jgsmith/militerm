    sight: >
      You are walking along a narrow stony path which leads westwards to vast marshlands. The mosquitos have
      found your blood very tasty and you start slapping them on your skin. If this is what it is here, what
      might it be when you go further to the west? You wonder if you will catch malaria in this place. The
      path leads west and back to the east.
