    short: The Hall
    sight: >
      You climb down the stairs and come into a hall which has exits west, south, up and down. The hall itself
      has no furniture, but the floor is so soft that you could actually sleep on it. The ceiling is emitting
      blue light and the walls are covered with somewhat extraordinary pictures about the history of
      spacetravels.
