      A big stone block separates the ceiling from the floor looking anything but steady. Seems that the
      ancient architects never learned to construct vaults even though they had the skill to build these great
      monuments. This wide, but rather low room has obviously served as some kind of a storage room since
      there are several &+yclay pots&* near the back wall.
