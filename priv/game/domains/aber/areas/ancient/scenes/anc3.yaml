    sight: >
      You find yourself on an ancient passageway which seems to have been the main street of an old town. The
      street is wide and paved with large grey flagstones. The street leads to the north while the southern
      way disappears under flourishing grass mat. The path to the west leads to a clearing and to the east
      there is a temple.
