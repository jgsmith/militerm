    sight: >
      You are standing on the top of the pyramid the sun shining brightly into your face. Right before you
      there is a small &+Yaltar&* probably made for sacrificing young virgins to the sun God. You might feel a
      great relief that you are no longer a virgin, but just simply another, run of the mill, filthy foul-
      mouthed wanderer.
