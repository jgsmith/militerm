    sight: >
      The street continues further north where the shape of the huge moon pyramid breaks the horizon. To the
      east you see a massive building made of clay and stones rising up to the skies before you. At this very
      moment the greatness of this ancient culture fills your mind and you can't help looking at this
      breathtaking view while holding your breath. You shake your head and draw your mind back to reality. To
      the west you notice a small house.
