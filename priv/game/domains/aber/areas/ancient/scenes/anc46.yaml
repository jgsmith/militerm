      As you walk further the walls turn smooth and the floor is covered with complicated and extremely
      beautiful ornaments. The ornaments are surrounding a long series of small pictures that seem to tell
      tales about this town's history. The story begins with a flourishing dynasty and an emperor who ruled
      the surrounding plains. To find out more you have to walk further to a large underground hall to the
      north. You notice that you still can turn back to the south.
