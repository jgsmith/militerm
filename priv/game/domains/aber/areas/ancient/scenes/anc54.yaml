      Saying your prayers every night before you go to bed seems to pay. The walls of the room you just
      entered are covered with silver reflecting the expensive tastes of the priest living here. The room has
      no natural light, but two burning torches on the south wall are bringing light over the place. The exit
      is to the north.
