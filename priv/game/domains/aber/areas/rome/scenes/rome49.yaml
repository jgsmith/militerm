    sight: >
      You are standing in the workshop of Froboz the Great, the most powerful and famous mage that Rome has
      ever known. Workbenches line the walls and are covered with various test &+Ctubes, beakers, petri
      dishes&* and crucibles and there is an odor in here that can best be described as a combination of old
      sweat socks and burning tires. The only exit is back through the door through which you came. In the
      middle of the room, you see a pile of ashes that looks like it once was a body and Froboz is busy making
      adjustments on a new type of magic wand .... possibly the one responsible for the explosion a few
      minutes ago. He removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns around. 'How in the name of Merlin
      did you get in here??!!' he asks. 'Oh, nevermind! Since you are here, you can serve as witnesses to the
      final test of the new mage's spell: 'ectowatt'.' With this he makes a magical gesture and the Paladin
      Knight appears. Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his direction and what happens next is
      incredible! The Paladin is enveloped in what appears to be a small, well contained, thermonuclear
      explosion. When the smoke clears you can see that the Paladin and all of equipment has been reduced to a
      large pile of flaming &+Rcinders&*. Froboz throws his head back and cackles with insane glee. 'Now, my
      young friends, what can I do for you?' he asks.
