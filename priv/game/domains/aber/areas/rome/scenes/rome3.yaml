    sight: >
      This is the western side commoner's seating area. There are row upon row of rough wooden benches bolted
      to the floor. There is stadium garbage everywhere and the smell makes you want to puke. Stairs lead up
      to Caesar's private box, a small ramp leads down to the playing field and a hallway leads south.
