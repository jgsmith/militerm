    sight: >
      You have just entered the main government building of the Roman Empire and are standing in a massive
      room with an elaborately decorated domed roof. There are many people here--messengers and senators being
      the most numerous. There is a large, ornate door to the west, a hallway leads north and marble stairs
      that lead out of the building are to the south.
