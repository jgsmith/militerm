    sight: >
      You are standing inside of the eastern gate of Rome. There are two tall &+Mspires&* built into the city
      wall, from which the guards can see the whole eastern side of the city. The &+ygate&* is currently open
      and to the east, there is a heavily used road, made of packed clay, that leads out of Rome. Another road
      leads westward into the city.
