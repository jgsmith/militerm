    short: The Aquaduct
    sight: >
      You are in a massive stone structure that has been designed to channel water into the city of Rome. Due
      to a recent drought, the water level is low, allowing passage without a boat. The walls and floor are
      covered with algae and slime, producing treacherous footing conditions. A valley lies to the south and
      the other cardinal directions lead further into the aqueduct.
