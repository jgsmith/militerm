    short: The Valley of the Gods
    sight: >
      You stand in a tranquil valley at the base of a large mountain. A quiet &+Bstream&* full of &+Cfish&*,
      with &+Rfruit&* trees growing along its banks, winds its way peacefully through the valley and enters a
      large stone structure that lies to the west. There are birds singing and every now and then a ripple
      breaks the surface of the stream. You can see a path leading up, through the trees. There is a small
      hole, from which you can hear rushing water, to the north.
