    sight: >
      This is a hard dirt track about a quarter of a mile long. There are hoof prints everywhere, and you see
      a large cloud of dust approaching. You had better move before you get run over. A small tunnel leads
      west, you can see the crowd to the east. You can hear loud snarls and roars coming from below.
