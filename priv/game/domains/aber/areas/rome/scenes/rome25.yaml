    sight: >
      People are standing in long lines here, waiting to buy tickets. There are 3 vendors working furiously,
      but hopelessly backed up. Ticket stubs litter the ground and you can see that the people are getting
      very impatient. There is a large, open &+Gcashbox&* here. Main entrances to the Coliseum are to the
      north and west.
