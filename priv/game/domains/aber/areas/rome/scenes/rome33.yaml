    sight: >
      You are walking on a paved road that runs north and south through the city of Rome. There are many
      people here, as polite as always. Most of them are either coming from or going to the town square which
      lies to the north. Nero Drive continues to the south. There is an observation area overlooking the
      aqueduct to the east and a paved road leads west.
