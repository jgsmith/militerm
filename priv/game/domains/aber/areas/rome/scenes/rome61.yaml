    sight: >
      You are standing in a very small room in which there are many tools designed specifically for inflicting
      pain and suffering. Some of them are familiar, such as the rack and the iron maidens. Others, you have
      never seen before and they make you wonder about the kind of sadistic mind that dreamt them up. The only
      exit is to the west.
