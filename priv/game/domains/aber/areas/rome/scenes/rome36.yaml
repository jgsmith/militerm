    sight: >
      You are standing in the emperor's private office. The room is richly furnished with the finest of the
      loot brought back from conquests of far away lands. There is a massive, intricately carved &+ydesk&*
      here, upon which are important &+Cdocuments&*, decrees and other paperwork involved in running the
      empire. On the far wall, there is a marble &+ybookcase&* that is well stocked with the works of Homer,
      Plato, Socrates and other wise men. Further, it seems that the current emperor likes &+Yflowers&* as
      there are many potted and cut specimens throughout the room. There is a french door leading to the
      waiting room and a wooden door to the south.
