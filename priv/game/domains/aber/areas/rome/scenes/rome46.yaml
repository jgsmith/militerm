      You are standing on a wide, heavily traveled road that runs east and west through the heart of the city.
      There are marble steps leading up. To the south, off in the distance, you can see a large &+Cstone
      structure&* and a &+ymountain that is partially obscured by the haze. There is a general store to the
      north.
