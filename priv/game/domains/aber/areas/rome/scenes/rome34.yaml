      This is a busy paved road that runs north through the city. The people of Rome are very friendly and say
      hello as you pass. A gate leading out of the city lies to the south and a small path goes west towards a
      nobleman's estate. To the east, off in the distance, lies the great mountain. It is rumored that the
      gods watch over and protect the empire from there.
