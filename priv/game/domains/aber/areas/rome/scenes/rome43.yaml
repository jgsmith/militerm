    sight: >
      You are standing in a very large room with a high ceiling and there are a few people waiting here to see
      the emperor on urgent matters. The master scheduler tells you to have a seat and sends a page to inform
      his highness of your arrival. There are large doors to the east and a gold plated door to the west along
      with an exit leads south to the foyer. There is a &+Csign&* here.
