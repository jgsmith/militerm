    short: Noble Estate
    sight: >
      You are on the grounds of a nobleman's estate which is hundreds of times the size and splendor of
      anything that a common citizen of Rome would ever hope to own. Everything is lush and green. The grass
      is perfectly manicured and the &+Gtrees&* are all bearing fruit. Ornamental plants are in perfectly
      situated to enhance and adorn the three statues of dedicated to gods Jupiter, Venus and Neptune. A
      tranquil path leads east and west, there is a paved road to the north and an extravagant house lies to
      the south.
