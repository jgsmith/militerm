      You are standing in the middle of a large open area which is the common area of Rome. During the day,
      this place is alive with the hustle and bustle of all of the citizens of Rome and everyone in the city
      is sure to stop by at some time or another. There are several street &+Yvendors&* peddling their wares
      and the overall atmosphere is carnival-like in nature. To the southeast, off in the distance, you can
      see the &+Baquaduct&* and the buildings of the Roman government lie to the northwest. Nero Drive leads
      north and south from here and Clay Avenue runs east.
