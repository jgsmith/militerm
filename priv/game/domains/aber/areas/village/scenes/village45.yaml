    sight: >
      You are standing in the opening of the village gates. Many adventurers before made the step outside. An
      unknown number of them aren't around any more to tell their story. The gates used to be heavily guarded,
      but it has been a while now since the gates were closed. To the east you can enter the village
      marketplace while to the west a path leads into the forest. Just outside the gates you can go south to a
      rough patch of land to the south of the village.
