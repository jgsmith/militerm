      You are crouched in the barman's small, and very personalized room. The walls have a large collection of
      battered naval memorabilia fastened securely to them. Indeed, even the lone window is a porthole, giving
      the room that distinctive sea-cabin look. A single low doorway leads west into the inn proper.
