    sight: >
      You are standing behind the bar of the 'Old Seadog'. The bar surface is worn and pitted from years and
      years of heavy use. Names are carved into its surface, 'Black Sea Pete', 'Grey Hook', 'Moog The Kipper',
      no doubt some of the pirates who long ago made this their haunt. A narrow stairway leads down, and a
      small room can be seen through a low doorway to the east.
