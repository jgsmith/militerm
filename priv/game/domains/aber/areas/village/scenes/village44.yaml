    sight: >
      You are standing on a large square near the village gates. On special days this square is completely
      filled with merchants selling their products. In the middle of the square a very old oak provides some
      shadow from the sun. To the east the square changes into the village green. To the west you can see the
      old gates that protected the village from the evils of the forest.
