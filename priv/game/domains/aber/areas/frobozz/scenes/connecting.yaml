    short: Wide Tunnel
    sight: >
      You are in a wide and smooth tunnel with an entrance just north of you which leads into a room which
      looks like a workshop. This tunnel also continues to the east another 10 or 15 feet where it is abruptly
      cut off by a brick wall. There is an arched opening in the brick wall, through which you can see racks
      and shelves.
