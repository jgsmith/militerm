      You are in what must be the entrance to the vault of the bank because written on top of the southern
      wall are the letters "V A U L T". But you can't seem to find the vaultdoor. Is it simply a
      walk-through-wall or is the vaultdoor fitted so nicely into the wall that you can't find it ? The room
      is lit by some kind of light which comes through a thickglassed &+Cwindow&* measuring 1 foot in square
      set into the northern wall. The tellers' room lies to the west.
