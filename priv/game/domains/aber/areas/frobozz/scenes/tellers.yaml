    short: The Tellers Room
    sight: >
      You have entered the tellers' room. This is where the transactions of money once in the past happened.
      There are about a dozen of tidy and rather impressing desks here which were used by the tellers when
      doing business with their clients. The desks are now covered with dust. To the south, through a high and
      arched opening you can look into an impressive hall. It is probably the main hall of the bank of
      Frobozz. Through a similar, but smaller opening to the north you see a large and representable office.
      There is also a doorway to the east and to the west a doorway leads back into the luncheonroom.
