      You are down at the base of the damwall which stretches up houndreds of feet above you. Right above you,
      out of the wall, three thick powerlines emerge and they are streched over a small, but very fastflowing
      river out of sight to the southwest. A very fastflowing river emerges out of the damwall a couple of
      yards west of you and disappears out of sight into southern parts of the cavern. There is no way of
      following the river southwards or crossing it. Sparks jump now and then from lots of tiny cords which
      hang down from the three powerlines, thus enlightning the place in a strange blue and green light. This
      place is surely in lack of maintainance, so you would better get out of here. It can be done by climbing
      a flight of stairs which is cut out in the side of the wall.
