    sight: >
      You are standing on the eastern part of a damwall. The damwall, being about 30 meters wide continues
      westwards to the other end of the cavern. Through a door to the east there's a little office obviously
      used by maintainance personell in the times when there where more traffic here than at present. There's
      also a flight of steps leading down on the south side of the damwall. It disappears into the deep and
      dark dry area of the cavern which is kept dry by the damwall. To the north you can make out the
      beginning of a staircase leading up.
