    short: The Bank of Frobozz
    sight: >
      You are in the main hall of the bank of Frobozz. The roof is held up by mighty stonepillars like those
      you saw outside the main door which leads into this room. The ceiling is made of dark wood, and combined
      with the light colours which the walls are decorated with and the fine gold inlay in the massive pillars
      the whole room resembles something like a temple raised for a highheld god. Right to the north is the
      tellers' room and that's where you may withdraw sparemoney or let the bank take care of them. In the
      south wall of this stunning room there is the main entrance to the bank. The door is barred with strong
      ironbars which makes the bank look very safe.
