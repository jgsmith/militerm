    short: Dark and Drafty Chamber
    sight: >
      You have entered a dark and drafty chamber. The draft is not that strong here, but that is because this
      chamber is much bigger than the narrow tunnel you used to get here. This chamber is nearly pitch dark,
      but a few sunbeams manage to get through a crystal grating in the ceiling. The grating is just reachable
      but the size of it prevents you from climbing through it when opened. Worth noticing are the extremely
      dark walls of this chamber. It is as if they are made of lightabsorbing material. There is an exit to
      the south and another exit into a pitch dark chamber to the east.
