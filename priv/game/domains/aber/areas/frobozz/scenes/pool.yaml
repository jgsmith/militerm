    sight: >
      You are standing on a ledge a couple of feet above a pool filled with water from the waterfall above
      you. The noise of the waterfall hitting the pool is quite immense, but you still feel relaxed by being
      here. A few salmon are swimming around in the clear water snapping a fly now and then. A rainbow spans
      the pool in the spray of the waterfall. The water flows southwards forming a river which through
      thousands of years has dug out a big canyon cutting through the land. To the west, across the canyon,
      you can see large fields and further beyond, a mountainrange. A though, but managable climb will take
      you up into the mountain above, while a southgoing track leads into a vast forest.
