    sight: >
      You are in a cellar right under the livingroom. The air here is a bit damp, and together with an odd
      human-like smell drifting in from the south this place is not where you would like to stay for the
      night. A faint light shines in from the north while a passage leads south into darkness and what you
      sense is danger. You may of course also retreat back up into the livingroom.
