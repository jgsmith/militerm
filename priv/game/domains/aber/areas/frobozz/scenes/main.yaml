    sight: >
      You stand in front of the main entrance of the bank which is dominated by a huge and arched oakdoor set
      between mighty pillars carved out of rock in one piece. The door is barred with strong ironbars and it
      will take you a lot of work to get through it. It is possible to go east and west from the main
      entrance.
