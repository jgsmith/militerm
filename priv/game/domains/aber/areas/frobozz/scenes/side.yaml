    sight: >
      This is the west side of the bank of Frobozz and it seems much more promising than the main entrance.
      That is due to a door of normal size and construction which is situated right in front of you in a
      corner of the building. The bank is certainly in lack of windows, but you have already figured out that
      the bank trusts the Great Under- ground Empire's inhabitants because this side entrance will certainly
      not be impossible to break down even for you.
