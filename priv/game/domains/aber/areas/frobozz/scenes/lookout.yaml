    sight: >
      You are standing on a wide ledge overlooking a huge cavern. The river in the canyon west of the house
      comes into the cavern through a large opening to the north, filling it with water. Bright light shines
      through the opening of the cavern and, reflected by the water, it illuminates the cavern with dim light.
      The water flows slowly southwards into a huge reservoir in the deeper parts of the cave. An eastward
      path leads back to where you came from.
