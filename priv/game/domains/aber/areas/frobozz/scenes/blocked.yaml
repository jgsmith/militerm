      You are standing in the wide and highvaulted passage. Unfortunatly the passage has been block off by
      what to normal standards looks like a major cave-in. The cave-in consists of nothing but large and
      immovable rocks. From marks and scratches on the rocks you realise that there have been other people
      here before you who have tried to make a passage through the cave-in. You might as weel give up the
      thought of getting beyond this major rockfall. A wiser decession is to reenter to the west and try the
      north or south passage.
