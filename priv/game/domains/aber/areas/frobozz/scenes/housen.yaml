    sight: >
      You are standing in an open field north of a white house, with a boarded front door. The house is
      surrounded with dense forest to the north and the east, and west of the house a deep canyon splits the
      country from north to south. There's a path which runs north into the forest and two smaller paths which
      runs from the front door and around the house east and west.
