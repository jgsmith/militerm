    sight: >
      You are standing at the corner of a building which looks like a bank. It could as well be something
      else, but the word BANK was the first word that entered your mind when getting near this place. Let's
      say it is a bank. The bank is actually not another cave, but it is built in a large cave, and may
      therefore be called a building. The main entrance to the bank is to the east, and north of here there is
      a door which also leads into the bank. A wide and high vaulted tunnel starts here and leads south.
