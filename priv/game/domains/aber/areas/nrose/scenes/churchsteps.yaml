    sight: >
      You are standing in front of a romanesque church that serves as the place of worship for the monks. The
      steps that lead up to the doors are covered with dead leaves that are stirred about by the gusts of the
      wind. To the south is the monastery bell tower and to the north is a much larger tower.
