    sight: >
      You have entered the monastery ossarium. The room has bones stacked up everywhere, some in niches dug
      into the damp walls, others piled up on the ground. As you walk around, your feet slosh through the mud
      on the floor. There is a heavy, musty smell here and you feel strange as if you are walking closer to
      your own death. As you look around you see a stairway up and to the north is another part of the
      ossarium.
