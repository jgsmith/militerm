      You have entered the monastery scriptorium. Along one side of the room are a set of stained-glass
      windows. Next to these windows in neat rows are wooden desks and book stands where the monks laboriously
      copy and illuminate books. Ah, the monastery must have a library around here somewhere but where can it
      be?
