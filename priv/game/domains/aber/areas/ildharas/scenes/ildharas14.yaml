      You get the impression that the inhabitants have merely stepped out on a drill. The beds look as though
      they've been recently slept in, and greasy cards lie scattered on a wooden table, halfway through a hand
      of poker. Someone held four kings. but never got to collect. A doorway leads back outside to the east
      and another goes west to the stables.
