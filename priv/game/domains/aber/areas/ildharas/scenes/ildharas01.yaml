    short: Grassy Field
    sight: >
      Tall, knee high grass rustles gently with your passing. Tiny insects fly up at the disturbance and buzz
      around your head. A forest of spruce and pine grows to the north. Upon closer inspection, you can see a
      narrow and often overgrown path through the trees. Much of the southern field has been converted into a
      graveyard. Two large boulders surround a path to the west, the fields turn golden toward the east.
