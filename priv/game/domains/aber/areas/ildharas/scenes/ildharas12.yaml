      You clamber up upon the wall and peer into Rodney's nest. What a diverse collection of valueless junk!
      Bits of old string lie matted and chewed next to old papers, pen caps, odd socks, bent pennies, candy
      wrappers, ruined and discarded floppies, and rusted nails. What a useless mess. It stinks, too.
