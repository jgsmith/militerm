    sight: >
      A small antechamber lies outside a much larger room, perhaps meant as a waiting area. Eternal candles
      gleam softly in their silver holders, and you note that the walls are purple and curiously smooth, like
      glass. The floor is so polished that you can see yourself in it. Silence lingers here, deeper than the
      falling snow.
