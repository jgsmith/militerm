    sight: >
      The stairs end at a small door, carved from an exotic dark wood streaked with silver. Looking straight
      up, you see the ceiling covered with the burnt remnants of a mural. The various parts left seem to be
      focusing on a spot right above, but it's too blackened to guess it's subject or intent.
