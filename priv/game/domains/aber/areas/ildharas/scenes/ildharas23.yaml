    sight: >
      The books have all been gutted, their contents scattered throughout the room. The pages rustle like
      leaves as you walk. You behold not the destruction of knowledge, but it's chaotic fusion, a systematic
      but random dispersion of it's potency. 	A set of marble stairs leads up to the second floor, and
      doorways lead south and west.
