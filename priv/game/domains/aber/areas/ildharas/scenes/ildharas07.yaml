    short: The Gates of the Outer Wall
    sight: >
      A castle rests at the northern end of the valley, its walls in ruins. The gates remain the only portion
      of the outer defenses still intact. The walls on either side are breached in many places. Oddly, the
      castle beyond seems untouched by the elements.
