    short: Outer Courtyard
    sight: >
      The outer courtyard offers a strange juxtaposition between then and now. A majestic castle rests against
      the mountainside to the north, untouched by time. A crumbling and age-worn wall molders to the south,
      ruined and ancient. The architectural styles suggest the two were built together, but how could one age
      and the other not? A smithy lies to the east and a barracks to the west, these also intact.
