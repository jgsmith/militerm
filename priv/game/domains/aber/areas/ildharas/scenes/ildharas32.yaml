      The room smells of expensive musks and spicy food. A long wooden table sits in the center with the
      remains of a feast upon it. Silver candlesticks stand untarnished by age, and no dust adorns the
      settings. Goblets half-filled with wine litter the table beside greasy napkins and dirty plates. It
      looks to have been a mirthful evening.
