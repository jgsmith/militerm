    sight: >
      The wall seems to have crumbled on its own accord in some places, falling in on itself as time and the
      elements have worn it down. Looking up, you notice what appears to be a nest of sorts. Years of bird
      droppings have eaten away at the stone, making it rough enough to climb if you really cared.
