      The Sulking Swan heads directly to its berth, lining up alongside the wooden platform. Ropes move of
      their own accord, rising from the pilings and intertwining themselves with the boat's brass brackets. It
      seems safe to step east onto the second dock, or you could just sit here and keep the boat company.
