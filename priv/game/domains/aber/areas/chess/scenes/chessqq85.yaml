    short: The Second Dock
    sight: >
      You decide that this dock is much sturdier than the first, and it feels quite nice to stand on firm
      ground again. The boat is tied to the west, and a nice red wooden door waits expectantly at the east end
      of the dock- it seems to lead directly into the tunnel wall.
