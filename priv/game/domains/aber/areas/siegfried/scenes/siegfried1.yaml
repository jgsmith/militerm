    sight: >
      You don't understand why but the panorama slowly changes from the building to a beautiful golden sand
      beach. It's a sunny day and the sun is really hot. You hear the waves pounding on the sand. This
      splendid place gives you just the taste of lying on a soft towel to sleep on the sand. Not far off the
      coast you see a shimmering light coming from the sea. As you approach from the source of the light, you
      discover that's a sword.
