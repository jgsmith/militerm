      The sea has turned to calm that is almost unsettling. Any sailor would bow their head and say a quick
      prayer to the Sea God at this time to pray for a wind of some sort. Looking in all directions, the sea
      is still and quiet. A rocky shore is to the south, its boulder riddled area too cluttered to be passed
      along. A long jetty lies to the east running north into the ocean, a tall lighthouse at its end.
