    sight: >
      A calming, fresh breeze blows in bring the fresh scent of the open sea and the tang of salt with it. The
      sea appears to be cooperating with travel, only gentle swells at this point. The sea is dashed again and
      again against the rock face of a cliff on the south side. To the west a huge opening in the cliff can be
      seen, opening into a large bay.
