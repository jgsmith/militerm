    sight: >
      Looking down to the lands of your birth, you suddenly feel incredibly homesick, likely due to the
      enormous distance between you and your family. To the west you can barely see the tower from which you
      entered into the night sky. Far to the east you can see the constellations Aries, Leo and Sagittarius.
