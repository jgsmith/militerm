    sight: >
      You are standing on the deck at the bow end of the pirate ship. Cannon emplacements line the sides, and
      a small pile of cannon balls is beside each cannon. A small hatchway leads down into what is apparently
      the hold, and a small plank leads out over the ocean to the east. Around the ship, you see clear blue
      water, infested with man-eating sharks.
