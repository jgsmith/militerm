    sight: >
      You are on the shore of a lagoon that fills the center of the extict volcano. Beautiful blue water laps
      gently against th sand, and because it is crystal clear, You can make out some sort of submerged
      building. A small set of stairs lead down into the water toward the building, and to the east, a pathway
      leads through the side of the volcano.
