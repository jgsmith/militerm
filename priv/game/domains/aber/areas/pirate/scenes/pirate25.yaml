    sight: >
      You are under the surface of the lagoon. To the west of you, amidst the seaweed flaoting gently on the
      current, you see the entrance to the submerged temple. Though eroded and barnacle covered, it looks
      stable and remarkably intact. To the east, a narrow staircase leads up out of the water.
