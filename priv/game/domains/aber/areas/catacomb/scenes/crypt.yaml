    sight: >
      You are in a small room, standing before the entrance to a vast and ancient crypt. Low moaning sounds
      echo from within the catacombs before you, sending chills up your spine. An archway, its keystone carved
      in the shape of a human skull, leads south into darkness, while cool air blows in from the relative
      safety of the church above.
