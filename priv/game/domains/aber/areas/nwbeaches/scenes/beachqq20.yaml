    sight: >
      You stand in a small chamber just inside the front door of the lighthouse. Just south of these cramped
      stucco walls is the main living room of the lighthouse. You can hear and smell a crackling, warm fire in
      the fireplace, a dog's contented panting, and the sound of a young lady's laughter from the next room.
