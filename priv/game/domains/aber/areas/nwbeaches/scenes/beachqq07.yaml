    sight: >
      You stand on a sandy beach which runs along the shore east to west. To the east you can just barely make
      out the rooftops of a large city which sits nestled in a cove on the shore of the ocean. To your west
      you see that the beach gets a bit rockier than where you currently stand. A set of steps lead up the
      cliff face just to the west of you.
