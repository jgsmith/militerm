    sight: >
      This large room looks as if it has spent many happy times in the company of the Lighthouse Keeper and
      his family. The dinner table looks as if it always would have room for one more, the fire always warm
      and comforting, and of course, Max would always be around to play catch or get his ears scratched. To
      the east, you see what looks to be one of the family's bedrooms, the same to the west. Both have doors,
      but both doors are wide open. A spiral stairway leads up into the lighthouse top, where the Keeper must
      spend a great deal of his time.
