    sight: >
      This small room is more or less just the roof top of the lighthouse which houses the light. A narrow
      walkway encircles the light, so that regular maintenance can be performed. Some shelves on the walls
      hold tools and oils which keep the machinery in fine tune so that no ships run afoul of the many rocks
      in this part of the ocean.
