    sight: >
      The beach slopes upwards, slowly, gently toward the town to your east which sits on a huge plateau. You
      can now hear the sounds of a great many voices coming from that direction, however traffic along this
      beach is at a bare minimum, which is to say not at all. There must be another entrance into the town
      somewhere. To your west, the beach continues into the western horizon.
