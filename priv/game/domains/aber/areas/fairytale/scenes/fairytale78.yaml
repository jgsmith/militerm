    sight: >
      A series of rungs have been set into the wall of this well to allow access to the bottom. They are cold
      and slimy, and you pray that no rain falls to raise the level of the brackish water below. On the east
      wall, far below you, is a door which you suspect you could reach if you jumped from the rungs.
