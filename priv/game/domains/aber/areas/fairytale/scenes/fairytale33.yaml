    short: Window Room
    sight: >
      This room is filled with towering stained-glass windows. It seems that it was once a church of some
      sort, but you do not recognize any of the figures depicted in the glass. An altar stone still stands
      here, its cold grey stone reflecting the colored light from the windows. One of the windows is clear,
      and you see a tree outside. One branch seems to be close enough to the window to touch.
