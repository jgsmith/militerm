      This room overlooks the town of Fairyville. Below, you can see all of the houses spread across the
      countryside. Far in the distance you can see Rapunzel's tower, the Shoe of the Old Woman In the Shoe,
      and Jack's Cottage. To the east is a spinning room, and to the north is a room set aside for sewing.
