      The seats of this ride are red vinyl, and the floors are sticky. You sit down and rest for a moment, as
      the car begins to move. Soon you are high above the carnival grounds, and you can see a huge fun house,
      a balloon ride, and a gigantic castle on a cloud in the distance. After a few minutes, the car returns
      to the ground.
