      You stand in the doorway to the fabled house of Cinderella. Her famous housecleaning abilities are
      reflected in this dust-free environment. A stairway leads up to a small landing, on which you can see a
      table. A fireplace on the far wall, where she was rumored to have slept, has a pallet spread in it.
      Wandering over to a table, you are startled to see your reflection in it. Amazingly, she has even done
      the windows.
