      The little mermaid, Ariel, has decorated her home with pictures of her father and sisters, as well as a
      statue of her husband, Eric. A large swimming pool is set into the east wall, where you see a fish and a
      crab. When you enter, they eye you suspiciously. Many common household items, such as Snarfblatts and
      Dinglehoppers, have been placed around the room in positions of honor. One Snarfblatt hangs on the wall
      with a plaque beneath it.
