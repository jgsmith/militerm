    sight: >
      The lake is a large body of water. It looks very deep, and you could probably swim in it if you wanted
      to, but you doubt that the fish that live there would appreciate that. To the west is a playground, and
      to the north is a river, feeding into the lake. In the distance, to the east, you can see a statue
      standing alone on an island.
