      This is the fabled home of Sleeping Beauty. Somewhere in this house, it is rumored, a woman sleeps,
      having been cursed by an evil witch to slumber forever. The house itself is rather large, and you
      suspect it would take quite some time to investigate the whole place. A kitchen is to the east, the
      living room is to the north, and to the south lies the dining room. Here, in the entrance hall, a series
      of coat hooks line the wall.
