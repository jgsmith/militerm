    sight: >
      You are in a large living room, which extends the depth of the house. To the west it continues, and to
      the south is a kitchen. Out the window to the east you see a staircase going up to the next level. A
      card table is set up here, with a deck of cards and four piles of colored discs. Four chairs have been
      carefully set around the table. In the corner is a bar, fully stocked.
