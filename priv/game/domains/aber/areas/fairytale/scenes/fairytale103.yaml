      You are in a large living room, which extends the depth of the house. A piano stands in one corner, and
      a large display case is next to the southern door. The display case is filled with several pieces of
      fine china and valuable-looking artifacts. A white pipe extends from ceiling to floor, from which you
      can hear the sound of running water. To the south is the entry room, and to the east the living room
      extends.
