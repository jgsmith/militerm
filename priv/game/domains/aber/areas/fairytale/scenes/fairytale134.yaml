    short: Weaving Room
    sight: >
      This room is devoted to the art of weaving. Tapestries decorate the walls, and an intricate pattern
      decorates the rug on the floor. A large loom stands against the north wall, on which hangs a nearly
      finished rug. A window looks out onto the street below to the west; a door leads south to the sewing
      room, and to the east is a closed door.
