      This room is in TOTAL dissaray. Items seem to have been swept of the room's numerous &+yshelves&* and
      just dumped on the floor. The room has an unfamiliar smell, and you wrinkle your nose in disgust. An
      great sliding &+Cwindow&* is open to the south and leads to the balcony, and a heavy iron door is to the
      east.
