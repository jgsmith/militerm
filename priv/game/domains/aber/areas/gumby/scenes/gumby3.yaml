    short: A Portrait of Clay
    sight: >
      The haunting sound of Depeche Mode echoes around this eerie Daliesque panorama. A flat rubber surface
      extends in all directions with walls on the north and south. The northern half is bathed in sunlight;
      the southern half is shrouded by the umbra of a neverending eclipse. The bright wall is finely appointed
      with a large portrait of a beautiful young woman, which is surrounded by six smaller portraits of
      beautiful women, and one of a handsome young man. Below two of the portraits are vases of roses: one of
      red, the other of white. There seems to be extensive room for expansion here. A glowing portal to the
      north leads to the Temple of Paradise. The dark wall, in contrast, is rocky and uneven. Next to a
      claw-marked portrait of a man that can only be Gumby float two glass spheres. One contains a blackened,
      decaying heart. The other has what you presume to be the last tear that Gumby shed. A shattered door
      leads from here to the Wastelands of Hell. At the schism of light and darkness is a swiveling chair,
      facing a mirror from every direction, so that everything in the room is always seen. A couch stands next
      to the chair, facing away from the darkness and wholly in the light.
