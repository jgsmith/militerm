    sight: >
      As you step out from the sanctum, you feel the whisper of curtains closing behind you. Ignoring them,
      you step out to overlook the rail, where you see a white beach and a deep blue sea. The skies have just
      begun to clear, and a rainbow begins to peep through. From the dawn of the new day's sun, each of the
      colors in it shines through brilliantly. As you peer over the rail of this small, cement balcony, you
      can see the dark blue ocean crashing against a rocky shore several hundred feet below you. A salty,
      brisk wind rushes through the air leaving the taste of salt on your lips. A gentle breeze trickles
      through your hair as you look down to the sea, and spot a dolphin jumping into the air. On the edge of
      the sea near the beach, children are playing games and swimming. Further out, you notice the fisherman
      set out for this morning's work.
