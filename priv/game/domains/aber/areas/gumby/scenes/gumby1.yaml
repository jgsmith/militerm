    sight: >
      You are surrounded by thousands of rose bushes, carefully tended by the ascetics who care for the
      temple. The path is made of what looks like garnets and jade stones, which form a gently curving way. If
      you look on either side of you, you can find tiny panther cubs running through the bushes, watching your
      every move. To your left is a giant golden cage lined with the purest of black satin pillows, the
      resting place of the sacred cubs. As you make your way toward the altar, you glance at different shades
      of rose everywhere. They are on the floor, hanging on golden threads from the ceiling, draped across the
      seats and attached to the green and red curtains hanging from the hooks on the walls. The scent of
      jasmine wafts into your nose, announcing the entrance of the Priestesses, waiting for the evening's
      audiences with those in need of their aid. You step out of their way as they approach the shining altar
      in the back of this temple. One thing that strikes you as they pass by is that they all have enticingly
      soft green eyes and flowing red hair. The altar is cut of a single ruby which rises to the level of your
      chest. Carved into the wall of diamond above and behind it is a fountain depicting a naked Nymph pouring
      shimmering water out of a flask. As you reach forward to let the water fall over your hand, you feel a
      wave of calmness and joy wash over you.
