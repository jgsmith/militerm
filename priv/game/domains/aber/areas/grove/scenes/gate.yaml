    sight: >
      A large dingy gate lies before you, half-way open, partially hidden in the dense foliage. Even in this
      beautiful land, you get an odd sense of forboding when you look at the gate. There is a sign:
      +-----------------------------+ | NO MORTALS ALLOWED ACCESS | +-----------------------------+
flag:
  - soundproof
