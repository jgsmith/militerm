    short: Fates Cavern
    sight: >
      This is the Cavern of the Three Fates. In one area you see a place for sleep, another a place to cook.
      In the center, a large fire burns brightly. In one corner, there is a spinning wheel. In another, a
      large tapestry is being woven on a loom. The place is quite cozy, and you get a sense of great power
      from being here.
