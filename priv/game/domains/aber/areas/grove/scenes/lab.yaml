      Here is where Mother Nature does her nature work. A class 'A' geneticist, she finds ways to alter the
      paths of DNA. Several large lab desks with large countertops fill the middle of the room, and shelves
      with beakers and flasks filled with chemicals line the walls. Many odd things are in this room that you
      don't dare touch, not knowing what next shall happen to you. Among these hum a few HOOD machines,
      automatically sorting base-pairs from DNA strands.
