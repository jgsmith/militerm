    sight: >
      You arrive at a garden full of fig trees. Some fruit ripens on the branches, swaying gently in the sun.
      Trees are everywhere, creating a nice grove that makes you feel comfortable walking around in. You have
      this weird feeling you read about this place in some sort of book involving two people and a snake of
      some sort.
