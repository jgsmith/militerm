    short: Entrance to the Elven Forest
    sight: >
      A magnificent expanse of forest spreads before you. The morning mist has not quite lifted totally from
      the ground, making the Elven Forest a mystical place to gaze upon. You feel awed. The ancient forest
      lies in grand splendor, as yet untouched by the two evils warring in your present time. Instead of
      corruptness, you are moved by the beauty the forest and wish that the trees would be this lush in your
      own time. You have no desire to leave this beautiful land. To the north you see an high overview of the
      forest, to the south you see the entrance of a dwelling of some sort, hidden well behind thick bushes.
