      Books upon hundreds fill this study. An immense library is secluded in this small dwelling, vast stores
      of knowledge lie here. Any book on any subject or author is here somewhere, waiting for the reader to
      pick them up lovingly. A desk with a highly advanced computer is cluttered by numerous tomes. Bright
      light filters in through the window, making this a nice place to be.
