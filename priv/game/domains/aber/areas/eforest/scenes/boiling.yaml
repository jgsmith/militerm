    sight: >
      You have entered another natural cavern. In the middle of the cavern is a huge lake. Indeed, the scene
      would appear to be quite normal if not for the fact that lake was actually boiling. It has become so hot
      in this room that water itself is unable to remain in its liquid form! Surely, you must escape this
      demonic realm soon! Avenues of retreat from here lie to the North and East.
