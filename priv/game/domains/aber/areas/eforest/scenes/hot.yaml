    sight: >
      You stand in a huge, natural cavern. It is not just hot, but rather almost unbearable. There certainly
      better be something valuable down here to make all of your suffering okay! To the south of you is
      another natural cavern, while to the east lies a passage which is obviously manmade. Just to the west is
      a stone door, set in the wall of the cavern. A diamond shaped hole lies in the center of the stone.
