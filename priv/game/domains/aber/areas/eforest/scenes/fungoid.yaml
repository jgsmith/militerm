    sight: >
      You stand in an enormous cavern which seems to be wall-to-wall fungus. Besides mushrooms and other
      common fungus, you also see many unusual ones, much as in the fungus cavern above. As well, the green
      fungus from the the passageway to the North may be seen. An &+galtar &*stands here.
