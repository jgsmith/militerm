      The heat in this room is stifling. As you struggle to breath the scalding air, you manage to take in the
      surroundings. All about, you can see squalor. A broken &+Ctable&* lies off to one corner, with the
      remnants of a meal, ages old on it, and several broken chairs litter the floor. The room itself actually
      reeks of garbage, and covering the walls are a dried up substance that looks suspiciously like blood. A
      crudely letter sign on the wall reads GARD ROME. To the South is an archway that seems to lead into a
      somewhat cleaner room.
