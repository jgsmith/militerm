    sight: >
      You stand at the top of one of the mountains overlooking the valley. Just to the east, the path you are
      on becomes rather precarious, sloping sharply down into a rocky clearing. To the west, the descent is
      more gradual, ending in a rocky slope. You should be very careful. It looks like the area could all
      tumble down in a landslide in a second!
