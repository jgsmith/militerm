    sight: >
      You are in a large barracks for the dark elf troops. The whole place seems run down. &+yTrash&* litters
      the floor and most of the beds in this room are destroyed. It looks as if, for the most part, the dark
      elves do not bother to maintain an army now that their enemies, the good elves above, are gone. Exits
      leave these barracks to the West and East.
