    sight: >
      You are in a vast cavern. The ceiling is lost in shadows, but you can make out a ledge encircling the
      room. Evenly spaced along the ledge are stone &+Bgargoyles&*, which seem to be jeering at you. In the
      wall far to the north, you see the black mouth of a passage out, and the room seems to continue to the
      east, where dim light can be made out. To the south, an upward sloping passage seems to ascend to the
      surface.
