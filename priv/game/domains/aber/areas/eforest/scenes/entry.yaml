      Standing at the entrance to this system of caves, the only description which comes to mind is 'hellish.'
      The caverns glow with a strange red glow which speaks of nothing more than hellfire. It almost seems to
      you that you can hear the screams of the damned. A set of stairs leads downwards, and the heat coming
      from below almost knocks you out. Just to the North is a roughly carved doorway. Next to the door is a
      sign which says : Please check in your souls before entering.
