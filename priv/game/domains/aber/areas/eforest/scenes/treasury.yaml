      This room seems to be somewhat cleaner than the guard room to the North, but not much. The same reek of
      garbage pervades the air, and piles of litter have been shoved to the sides of the room. However, in the
      center of the room is a wooden pedestal which has been polished to perfection, and which is exceedingly
      clean. You have come through the only entrance to this room.
