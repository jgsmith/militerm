    short: The Elven Forest
    sight: >
      You stand at the entrance of what was once a grand elven forest. Now, it lies in ruins about you.
      Blackened stumps abound and the trees which still stand reek of decay. This secluded vale has obviously
      been destroyed by some great disaster. You are overcome by a sense of foreboding! The evil which ruined
      this forest may still be around! Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to
      look about to determine your position. To the North and East are the mountains which shield this valley.
      The area to the South of you also heads into mountains, but a path makes passage possible. An archway
      marks a tunnel through the eastern mountains.
