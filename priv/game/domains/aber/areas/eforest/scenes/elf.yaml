    sight: >
      You have emerged into the largest subterranean cavern that you have ever seen. Above you, the roof lies
      somewhere beyond the radius of your light source, while to the sides of this cavern, you can just barely
      make out the walls. Most astounding is a temple lying in the center of this cavern, which has apparently
      been constructed entirely underground! The temple is made out of some type of dark stone which glows
      with an unholy black light. Without a doubt, this temple is dedicated to some dark deity. You may enter
      it to the North. Off to the east and south lie other exits from this cavern.
