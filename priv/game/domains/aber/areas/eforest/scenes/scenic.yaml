    sight: >
      Once, this mountain trail surely was the best place to view the elven forest. Now, you can only see the
      destruction. To the North and West, you gaze out at the corrupted, desolate land which was once so
      beautiful. Amid the destruction, you see a few points of life. Just to the Northeast of you stands a
      tall, healthy oak tree, while further to the North, you actually think you see green. The mountain trail
      you are on continues North and South, while a small path leads up from the forest to the West.
