    sight: >
      You are walking down a long passage which has been carved out of the heart of this mountain. It is
      obvious that great time has been spent carving this passage. You have heard rumors of the dwarves of the
      North cutting a passage through to a beautiful forest for the elves of this realm. Perhaps, that
      beautiful, fabled realm lies to the West!
