      With a morbid sense of curiosity, you enter the cave where you have been directed in order to check your
      soul. Quite surprisingly, you are not instantly zapped by some evil being. Instead, the room seems to a
      quite simple &+Ccoat&* room. Lining the walls are coats of every shape and size, checked in, no doubt,
      due to the heat below. You would laugh at how ridiculous this whole scene looked if not for the evil
      that you feel below you.
