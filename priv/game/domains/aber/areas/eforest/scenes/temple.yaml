    sight: >
      You stand in the treasury of this grand dark elven temple. This side room is just as beautiful, in its
      dark, alluring way, as the main worship room to the east. Looking around, you are surprised to see that
      the treasury is empty! A note to the side explains that the dark elven Priest has taken the treasures of
      the temple for its own 'protection.'
