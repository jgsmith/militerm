    short: Thorny Path
    sight: >
      You are ascending a path into the mountains, which continues to the North and South. The region seems
      just as desolate as the forest below you. The ground is cracked and dying, and the only vegetation is a
      thorny brush, which practically cover the path, ripping at your clothes. The entire Eastern cliff is
      covered by a wall of &+ythorns&*. On the other side, just to the West is a sharp dropoff. Past it, you
      can see the entire elven forest. The corrupted view turns your stomach.
