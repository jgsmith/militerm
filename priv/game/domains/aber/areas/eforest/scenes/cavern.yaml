    short: Cavern of the Dark Elves
    sight: >
      You have entered an enormous cavern. You are awed by the vastness of this room. As you acclimate to this
      dark, damp environment, you remember of the ancient legends you have heard of a dark race of elves
      living below the surface. Surely, this is their realm! Looking around you, this assumption is upheld by
      the many dark shapes you see moving in the shadows. You should move through these realms quickly. Surely
      the dark shapes would overwhelm you by numbers if you stayed here too long. Exits leave this cavern to
      the North, West, South and East, while a ladder leads up.
