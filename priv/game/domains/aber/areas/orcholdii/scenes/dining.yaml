    sight: >
      You have entered what can only be termed a dining hall, though you are shocked that orcs would even
      bother with one. There is a massive chandalier above the dining room table. The table though is only
      large enough for 6 to eat at and there are &+Ccushions and blankets&* piled all over this large room.
      From the scraps of food lying about you would guess that the orcs just eat anywhere they choose in here.
      A set of swinging doors leads south into the kitchen and the hallway is to the north.
