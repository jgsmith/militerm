    sight: >
      You are standing at the end of the northern hallway. The hall continues to be grandiose. There is a
      painting at the end of the hallway that would give even the coldest person nightmares. From the regalia
      it appears to be the queen of the orcs, Blanche. She must surely be ugly, even by orcish standards and
      to you her visage is downright frightening. There are doorways to the east and west, you should probably
      choose one fast.
