      You are amazed at the poor quality of the bedroom. It looks to be of the finest orcish make, that is to
      say the walls are somewhat rough and hewn out of the stone. They must not have gotten to this room in
      their remodeling yet. There is a pile of blankets and straw on the floor that you take is the bed and in
      a surprisingly human manner all manner of &+Cclothes&* are strewn about the room. You have no idea which
      are clean and which not.
