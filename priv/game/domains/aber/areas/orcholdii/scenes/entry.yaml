    short: Grand Entry
    sight: >
      You have entered what appears to be a grand palace at first look. There are stairs leading up to a
      balcony. There is a rosy marble floor and what appears to be a genuine crystal chandalier. There are
      grand archways leading north, south, and east. Then you notice that the nobility are actually orcs in
      human finery and begin to wonder if perhaps you're in the wrong place!
