    sight: >
      This is perhaps the grandest of the three hallways exiting the hall. The floor is done in a beautiful
      black marble and there are mithril &+Csconces holding globes of continual light. The most amazing object
      in the room is the ceiling. It is a mosiac of the history of the orcs done by a masterful artist. It is
      almost enough to bring you to tears. There are a pair of massive double doors standing open to the south
      and the hallway leads to an audience chamber to the west.
