    sight: >
      This is a gigantic courtyard. Not only is the place almost a mile across, but everything is HUGE! The
      path you are standing on is paved with cobblestones almost the size of things that you seem to remember
      being called Cadillacs, and the flowers that fringe the edges are as large as small trees. From the
      north you hear a loud roar that sounds like a waterfall and to the south you see what must be the
      garden, but it looks like a rain forest to you. The drawbridge is back to the west and the door to this
      gigantic castle is to the east.
