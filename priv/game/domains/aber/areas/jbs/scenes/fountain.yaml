    sight: >
      You are standing next to a huge fountain. The noise from the water is nearly deafening there is so much
      of it. The mist that comes off from the splashing water feels almost like rain, even though, here above
      the clouds, the sun is always out. If you stand on your tippie-toes you can just reach the top edge of
      the side to climb up if you want to.
