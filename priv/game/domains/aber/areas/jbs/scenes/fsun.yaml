    short: The Sun
    sight: >
      You find yourself suddenly walking on the surface of the sun. You are surrounded by a vast expanse of
      incredibly bright surface upon which through much squinting and shading you can vaguely make out the
      shapes of strange creatures floating around you in all directions. As you look down at your feet, you
      notice that they are on fire, but it seems ok because you can't feel any pain right now.
