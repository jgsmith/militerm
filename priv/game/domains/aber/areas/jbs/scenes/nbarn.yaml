    sight: >
      From here the barn looks about like any other barn that you've ever seen. The floor is covered with a
      thin layer of hay, and there are tools of various descriptions lining the walls. There is a leather
      saddle on the ground next to an old, horse-pulled plow against the east wall that doesn't seem to have
      moved for a while. The barn continues to the south, to the east and west are small stalls, and there is
      a ladder leading up to the hayloft against the west wall.
