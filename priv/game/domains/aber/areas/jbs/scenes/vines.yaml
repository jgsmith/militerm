    sight: >
      All around you the woods seem to have come to life! You find yourself struggling through the branches of
      mighty trees and thick ivy vines that are trying their best not to let you past. The mist is very thick
      here too making it quite difficult for you to know which way you came from and which way might lead out
      of here.
