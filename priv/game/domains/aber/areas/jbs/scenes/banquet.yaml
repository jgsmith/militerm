    sight: >
      You have entered a gargantuan banquet hall, and as you look around you find that the place is a total
      mess! There are old bits of food lying on the &+ytables, and all over the floor. There are bits of dirty
      silverware lying haphazardly around as well. From the north you hear the loud banging and crashing of
      utensils that tells you it must be the kitchen.
