      You find yourself in an infinite void. You seem to have forgotten where you made the wrong turn that
      brought you here, but you have to deal with it anyway. Off in the distances all around you you can make
      out millions of stars, but you can't seem to focus on any of them long enough to get your bearings
      because every time you move your head your field of vision is filled with millions of brightly colored
      trails coming from each star.
