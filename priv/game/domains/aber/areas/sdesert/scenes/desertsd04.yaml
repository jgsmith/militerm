    short: A Fork In The Path
    sight: >
      The small footpath you have been following splits here; one part leading off to the &+geast&* where it
      disappears into the sagebrush. To the &+ysouth&* the path continues, getting more and more overgrown as
      it goes. Near to the south the northern edge of the large mesa looms up, a black wall against the sky.
