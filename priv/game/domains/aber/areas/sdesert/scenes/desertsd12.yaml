    sight: >
      Here the desert forbids your life to get any easier, and you are forced to exert yourself to travel
      uphill. Cursing mother nature, you ignore your thirst and plod onward. To the &+ysouth&* the mountains
      rise up out of the earth like an ill specter. Other trails go &+ynorth and east.
