    short: Southern End of Cavern
    sight: >
      You enter the southern end of a tremendous cavern which spans out before you. The air here is turbulent,
      and filled with an excited energy which runs through your very soul like fire. The walls here are as
      black as the darkest coal, and the sand on the floor has been melted into a sheet of solid glass. It
      looks as if a great flame has passed through this room. A thunderous rumble which seems almost
      creaturelike, eminates from a cavern to the south. To the north lies the other side of this huge cavern.
      To the east is a small, ever-fluctuating porthole promising passage back to the realm you had come to
      know as reality, 'til now.
