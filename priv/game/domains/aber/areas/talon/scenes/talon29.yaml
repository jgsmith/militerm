    short: The Mist
    sight: >
      You step into a thick shroud of a choking, white fog. Your senses are confused as you wander aimlessly
      through the swirling mist. All of reality becomes a forgotten blur, as whispers seem to echo around ou
      from all sides, and shadows seem to lunge toward you, only to melt back into the depths of the unknown.
      To the west you can barely discern a glimmer of light through the mist, and to the east, the fog
      continues to billow out before you.
