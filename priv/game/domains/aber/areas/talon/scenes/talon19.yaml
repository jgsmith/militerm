    short: The Chasm
    sight: >
      You stand on a narrow natural bridge crossing a giant chasm. A bright yellow sun shines down upon you,
      and clears your darkness-ridden mind. A cool wind blows across your skin, reminding you of what it is to
      be alive, for now. Below, the chasm continues downwards, and disappears into a mist of swirling clouds.
      To the west, the bridge leads to a small ledge carved into the side of a mountain. To the east, a cave
      leads back into the large cavern.
