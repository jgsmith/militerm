    sight: >
      You stand at the base of a huge waterfall which cascades down from high above into a small deep pool.
      The water here is crystal clear, and seems to glow with a brilliant white light which covers the entire
      room and shines through the mist of the waterfall to form a rainbow which arcs across the entire cavern.
      The water from the pool flows to the west through a small cavern.
