    sight: >
      You stand at the base of a tremendous mountain peak which rises into the midst of the black smog which
      blankets this land. A large black stronghold lies near the top of the peak, and every so often a stream
      of fire emanates from the tallest of the towers of the castle. The sky here is now almost utterly black
      as any ray of the sun has been choked out of existence by the dark haze. A small and precarious path
      leads up the side of the mountain and a path continues back to the west of a valley bathed in shadows.
