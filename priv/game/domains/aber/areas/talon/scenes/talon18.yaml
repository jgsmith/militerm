    short: Northern End of Cavern
    sight: >
      You enter the northern end of a monstrous cavern. The walls here are as scorched as those in the
      southern end of the cavern, but they seem to glow with a dark, ruby-red fire. Although the walls are
      searing to the touch, the air is as cool and fresh as an October morning. To the west, light and a brisk
      wind pours through a large opening. Back to the south, the cave stretches out before you.
