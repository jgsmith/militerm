    sight: >
      The stream flows here from the north and continues in a cavern to the east. The rocks here are very
      slippery, and you feel as if at any moment you could lose your footing, slip, and be carried into the
      depths by the current rushing around you. There is a strange light shining through the water which
      appears to get brighter as the stream continutes to the east.
