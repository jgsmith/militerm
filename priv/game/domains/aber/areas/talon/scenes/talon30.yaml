    sight: >
      You stand upon a small foothill looking upon a charred, black valley. The entire valley looks as if a
      tremendous fire decended from the sky and consumed all life in its path. Blackened stumps lie here and
      there, where mighty trees once stood. A blood red haze encompasses the sky as the sun retreats behind
      the dark mountains, to no more shine its face upon the horrifying sight, for yet another starless night.
      To the east lies passage down into the valley. To the west lies a blanket of fog twisting and turning as
      if it were alive.
