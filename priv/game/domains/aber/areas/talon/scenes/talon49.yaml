    short: Top of Dragon Tower
    sight: >
      You stand atop a tremendous tower, which has been built partially into the side of a mountain. The tower
      lies above the black cloud which plagues this land, and the sun reflects its bright yellow rays from the
      blanket of smog stretched out before you. Far to the west lies a huge range of white mountains which
      tower ominously above this large peak, and behind the mountains a hint of deep blue suggests the
      existence of an ocean. To the east a deafening, dull roar echoes from a dark cave.
