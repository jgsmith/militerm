    sight: >
      The stream here becomes extremely fast, and disappears over a waterfall which plummets down, at least
      one hundred feet to the bottom. There is a light which seems to have gotten even brighter here than to
      the west, and it continues to increase in intensity as you look down the waterfall to the pool below.
      You think you might just be able to scramble down the rocks to the side of the waterfall, but it looks
      very treacherous. The stream flows in from a cavern to the west.
