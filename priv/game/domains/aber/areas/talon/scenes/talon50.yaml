    sight: >
      You enter a huge chamber which appears to house the beast, and destroyer of this realm. The air here
      seems to glow red hot, and the walls of this place are scorched a shade of black darker than the darkest
      night. To the east lies a small chamber, and the outside air lies to the west.
