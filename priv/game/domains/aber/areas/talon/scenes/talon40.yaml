    sight: >
      You enter a smaller hall with a lower ceiling. The black marble floor here is inlaid with the finest
      gold, and a great crystal chandelier hangs glittering from the ceiling. In the center of the room lies a
      tremendous dark dragon sculpted out of pure black onyx, with red rubies for eyes which seem to glow with
      a beastly fire in the light of the chandelier. Exits lead in all directions from here.
