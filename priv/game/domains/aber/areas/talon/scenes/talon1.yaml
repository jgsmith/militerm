    sight: >
      A large, moss covered cliff face is straight ahead of you. High above, ancient trees line the top of the
      cliff, and seem to ominously look down upon the travellers of this land. On a windless day as today, the
      branches seem to echo a whisper of warning and doom. There seems to be an entranceway carved out of the
      cliff face to the north, and the nearby trampled path from whence you came lies to the south.
