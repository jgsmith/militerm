    sight: >
      You pass under the black gothic arches, and stand in a large hall at the entrance of the stronghold.
      Black marble gargoyles crouch at the corners of this room, and seem to jeer down in evil delight at your
      curiosity which may just cause your demise. Above an archway to the east, the deep black letters TALON
      are carved into stone. To the east lies an entrance into a large chamber, and to the west lie the gates
      to this dark castle.
