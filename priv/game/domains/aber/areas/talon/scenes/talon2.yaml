    short: Shadowy Cave
    sight: >
      This is a small, damp, musty smelling cave. There are shadows lining two of the walls and a broken
      structure resembling a table lying in one corner of the room. To the east lies another room, too dark to
      discern its purpose. To the north lies a room resembling a storage area, and to the south lies the
      safety of a land bathed in fresh air and sunlight.
