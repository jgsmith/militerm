      Boy, the smell of sulfur just keeps getting stronger - YUCK! As if that werent bad enough, there are
      about a hundred horribly disfigured corpses laying here. It looks as though the flesh was eaten off of
      their living bodies as they writhed in agony. The stream of blood you witnessed at the entrance is much
      larger here, apparently you are onto something.
