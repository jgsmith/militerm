    sight: >
      You have reached the bottom of the granite staircase. This appears to be the basement of Blood Tavern. A
      hole in the ceiling which is stained with excrement hovers above an enormous mountain of feces (how
      nice). Walls stand to the west, north and south - but the way is passable towards the East, around the
      dungheap.
