    sight: >
      The incessant wailing of souls in torment causes visible shivers up and down your spine. The walls,
      floor and ceiling are a viscous, blood-red mass that eludes description. A rift in the ceiling above you
      causes a slight breeze to ruffle your hair. A magic portal stands south, leading into the unknown.
