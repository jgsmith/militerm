      As you look around in His closet, you see sun beams filtering through the dust and reflecting off the
      wooden floor. There are three chairs sitting around a table, showing off the closet's large size. There
      is not much too this room except the odd aura of energy surrounding everything inside it, making you
      feel quite powerful and tranquil at the same time.
