      You are in a large, tidy, and nice-smelling one room shack. There is a nice sized dinner table in the
      middle of the room with a white cloth over the it. An old iron stove sits against the north wall. The
      shack is nicely decorated with paintings hanging from walls and resting on shelves around the room.
      There is a door to the east that leads out to the town road, and to the west a door goes out to a large
      yard.
