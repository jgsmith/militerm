    sight: >
      Ahead of you is a magnificent, centuries-old temple built by the natives' ancestors. There are four
      obelisks near each corner of the temple which are rough and pitted from exposure. On top of the temple
      there is a moon-shaped bronze ring that reflects the sun's rays. Bits of crumbling clay roll of the
      walls of the temple as the wind blows. Two carved statues of lions sit proudly at the temple entrance.
