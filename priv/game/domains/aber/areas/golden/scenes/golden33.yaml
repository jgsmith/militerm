      You are standing in a small room with four exits. Each exit holds a fate that you will not know unless
      you enter it. The exit to the south will take you back to the round chamber, where you can sort your
      thoughts. There is a symbol carved above each exit. A faint yellow light shines from the western exit
      while a heavy, black mist drifts from the northern exit. From the eastern exit there is a soft, red
      glow.
