    sight: >
      You are standing in a large, grassy clearing with hardly any sharp rocks protruding from the ground.
      Exotic flowers and fruits grow in abundance here, for the thick jungle canopy is opened to let in
      sunshine in and a small stream trickles down a small bed of granite into a small pool of water which
      rounds the bend beyond your sight. Small animals scamper aimlessly around the ground, but keep a bit of
      distance between you and them. Coming from the west you hear the sounds of laughter and shouting, and
      you suspect that there might be a village of natives living near there.
