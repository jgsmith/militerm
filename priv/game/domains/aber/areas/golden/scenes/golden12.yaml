      You are standing inside a fairly large thatched hut. The walls are decorated with mystical writings and
      drawings. The ceiling tapers to a point, with different plants, herbs, and other items tied together in
      a bundle hanging by a rope. Large, woven mats cover the floor and a bed made of reeds and leopard skins
      occupies the western side.
