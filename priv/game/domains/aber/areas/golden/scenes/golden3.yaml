      The path seems to end abruptly here, turning into a rocky dirt path. The vegetation has grown much
      thicker now and vines have started to weave their way through the tree branches. Thick tree leaves have
      formed a nearly impenetrable canopy, squeezing out almost all the natural light shining down on the
      path.
