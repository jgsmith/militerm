    sight: >
      You are standing in dark, omnious hall. There are stone carvings of gods on the walls that watch your
      every movement. The walls seem to glow with a greenish light, which gets brighter as you advance. Some
      areas of the floor have crumbled away and reveal a bottomless chasm. There are pictures on the walls
      showing the demise of greedy humans.
