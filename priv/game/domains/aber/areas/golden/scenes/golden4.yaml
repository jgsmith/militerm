    sight: >
      Sounds of rushing water have become much louder and clearer, and the vines grow so thick and entwined
      along this part of the trail that you need a suitable tool to hack through them. Out of a smooth, moist
      crevice of rock a small stream of water flows west toward the sound of the rushing water. To the south
      there is a large, irregular tree residing along the never-ending path.
