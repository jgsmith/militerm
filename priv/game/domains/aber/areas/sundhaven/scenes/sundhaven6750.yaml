    short: The Lodge of Wrath
    sight: >
      The home lodge of warriors is a surprisingly comfortable place, furnished with a thick, hardy rug of a
      red so dark as to almost be black, beds shelved in bunks of hearty oak, a roaring fireplace in the
      corner. Several large chairs stuffed with coarse wool are situated round the fire for the rowdy telling
      of tales over inebriating brews.
