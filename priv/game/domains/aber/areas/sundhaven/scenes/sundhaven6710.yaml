    short: A garden of wild rosethorn
    sight: >
      Dense bushes of rosethorn, growing wild, fill the garden with splashes of white and red colors. There is
      a grassy space in the center, circled by smooth grey stones, where children play and older residents of
      the town picnic and enjoy themselves.
