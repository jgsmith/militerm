    short: A black-bottom pool
    sight: >
      Swamp-like waters black as coal enclose you and wash like cold slime over every limb, each movement
      sending a chill coursing through from ears to toes. The smooth, dark bottom of the pool shows traces of
      faded ornamental designs, now mostly hidden and eroded with moss and algae. Few can pin a name on the
      grotesque underwater creatures that now make this their home.
