    short: The shoreline and docks
    sight: >
      You step onto wood instead of rocks on a well-constructed dock. The docks haven't been used very much of
      late due to the dangerous sea creatures encountered by boaters. The fog is still thick along the
      shoreline, but the wind breaks it up in the open sea. If you're willing to go out on the open sea, there
      may be some boats tied up at the end.
