    sight: >
      You stand in the faerie glow of a portal of brilliant blue light. This is the gift of the previous
      Archmage upon his own guild. He went on to fashion further portals all leading all over the known world,
      before the Lady Assassin extinguished his life. Beyond the blue glare is a vision of the temple
      courtyard, the center of town.
