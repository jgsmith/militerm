    sight: >
      An ornate gate, heavy and wrought from black iron, hangs on ancient hinges to the west, bordered by
      slender elms. The ivy so plentiful in the town is twined and braided about its intricate coils and
      carvings, which consist largely of prowling cats and eclipsed circle designs.
