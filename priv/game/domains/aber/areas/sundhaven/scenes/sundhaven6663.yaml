    short: The chamber of sacrifice
    sight: >
      You have entered a somber chamber, somehow filled with darkness and still retaining shadows that seem to
      flicker in the recesses of the room. It appears a sacrifice to the matron deity of Sundhaven is
      scheduled to take place. You may watch, but be warned there are times set aside for the sacrifice of
      those who interfere.
