    sight: >
      You follow the thick wall of grey cobblestone that marks the outer border of Sundhaven. Moss, nourished
      by frequent rainfall, hides portions of the wall under its green tendrils. A stony path can be made out
      to the north, and the wall makes its way southwards to a corner.
