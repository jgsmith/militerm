    short: A garden of wild witchbane
    sight: >
      As you brush through the wild garden, a slightly sticky substance with a dark red hue adheres itself to
      your legs, raising the hairs of suspicion on the back of your neck. The tenuous climbing vines are dark
      green with black undersides, rather resembling.. poison ivy.
