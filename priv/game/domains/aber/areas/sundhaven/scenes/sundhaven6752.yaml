    sight: >
      You stand in the shimmering glow of a portal of rogue-black light. This is the gift of the Archmage to
      the assassin's guild, in return for a few bounties performed, of course. Ever wonder who put the Earl of
      Sundhaven in power?..Nevermind. Beyond the dark glare is a vision of the temple courtyard, the center of
      town, above you.
