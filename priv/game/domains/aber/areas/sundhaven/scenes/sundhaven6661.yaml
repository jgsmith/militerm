    sight: >
      Your steps echo in a hollow stairwell of naked stone. The air hangs light and silent about you as a
      curtain of falling snow, though there is a chanting taking place, seemingly miles away, in the chamber
      to the west. Lamps mounted on the walls give off a silver glow reminiscent of saints and martyrs,
      whether they died for the cause of good, or for evil.
