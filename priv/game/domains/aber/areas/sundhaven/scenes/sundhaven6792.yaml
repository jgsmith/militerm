    sight: >
      Here you have come upon a wider section of the piers allowing for larger boats to dock and perform
      loadings. The fog makes visibility low, with no fog horns or lighthouses to help you find your way. The
      open seas expand northward, while you can dock with another section of the piers to the east. The rocky
      shoreline countinues to the west.
