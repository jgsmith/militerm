    sight: >
      An old temple stairwell winds down in darkness into the inner, long abandoned recesses of the golden
      temple. It seems few have reason to travel this way. The dust that coats the steps lies mostly
      undisturbed, and an aura of desertion hangs about the place. Whoever does traverse these ancient halls
      may or may not have the light of goodness in their motivations.
