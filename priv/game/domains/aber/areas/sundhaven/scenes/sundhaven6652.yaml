    sight: >
      Shields and other items of heraldry line the sunken stone walls of the sparring room, gleaming with
      human pride. While not being overly promiscuous, the heads of foes are noticeably stacked one atop the
      other on a pole of polished wood in the corner. If you are looking to improve your skills in the art of
      battle, this might be a good place to start.
