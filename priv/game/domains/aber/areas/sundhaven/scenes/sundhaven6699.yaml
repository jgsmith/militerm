    sight: >
      You brush aside a curtain of dark green subterranean mosses and slip inside a roomy cave of pitch
      darkness. The place has an eerie feel, as if inhabited by some ethereal spirit that forbids you to abide
      within. Cool moss of deep azure and green hangs in flowing tresses from the ceiling, reminiscent of a
      prehistoric time.
