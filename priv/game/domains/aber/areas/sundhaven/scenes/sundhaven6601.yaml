    sight: >
      A myriad of candles, burning brightly in amber hues, illuminate the black-domed temple. This is where
      all adventurers of human ilk must begin their trials of danger and discovery. You stand in a cast of
      rosy-gold light, stretching along the floor from a stained glass window that serves as your first sight
      of the known world. The unknown world awaits you with open.. jaws. There is an &+Cinscription&* in the
      north wall.
