    short: The butcher shop
    sight: >
      You are enclosed in a poorly lit, stuffy room that smells of blood, salted meat and strange
      preservatives you didn't think existed in this time period. Pewter cases filled with ice give off wisps
      of steam near a roasting fire at the east wall. You might wonder why this place is situated so proximate
      to the gallows, but the butcher nonchalantly claims all his goods died peaceably, then turns away to
      stifle a chuckle.
