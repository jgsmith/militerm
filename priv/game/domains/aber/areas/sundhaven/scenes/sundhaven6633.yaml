    short: A gold sand road
    sight: >
      Sand of pale gold has been carted in from the desert lands to cover this road, reducing the sinking
      effect of mud during the rains. The air here is heavy with the smell of delicious food, fresh bread
      baking, and something spicier, to the east.
