    sight: >
      The stone-rimmed path opens out to a clearing of dirt, encircled by broad oaks and maples with leaves
      the color of honey. To the north a black gate is closed against the clamor of the world, and the road
      continues east to town, and west where it vanishes into a fog banked forest.
