    short: A black stone dwelling
    sight: >
      You stand in a quiet, empty dwelling of sturdy black sandstone. Occupied now by only a few spiders, it
      looks like it could be a comfortable place to live with a little work. With enough gold, perhaps one of
      the higher gods might sell it to you?
