    short: The Den of Sorcery
    sight: >
      The den of sorcery for mages and witches and wizards is a comfortable place, well-lit by magical rose
      and violet faerie fires for the reading of tomes. There is a rug in guild colors of blue and violet
      which spans the stone floor, and hammocks hang in rows along the walls, where the mages take their
      repose. A series of bookshelves provide ample guild literature, and an oak coffee table before a couch
      dominates the room.
