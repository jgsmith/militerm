    sight: >
      The dark greenery of the park extends eastwards, grown over with purple- flowering wisteria vine which
      slowly ambles up the town walls. To the south, the cliff lane runs east-west. An occasional explosion
      from a pale stone tower to the north startles you, and piques your curiousity about that strange place.
