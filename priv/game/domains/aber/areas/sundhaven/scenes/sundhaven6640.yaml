    sight: >
      You stand at a busy crossroads, darkened by the shade of an uneven ring of oaks trellised with ivy. The
      wind brushes the leaves, but this sound is dulled by the din of the town going about its daily business.
      Standing to the south is the hospital of Sundhaven, where many adventurers seem to end up after fighting
      one too many monsters and barely surviving. The ornate west gate lies just to the west, a road paved
      with black sand runs east and north is a lane shaded by oak and ash trees.
