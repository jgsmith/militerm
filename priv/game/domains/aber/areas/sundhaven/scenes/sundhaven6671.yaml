    short: A windy cliffside lane
    sight: >
      A damp and chilly wind wafts over the homes of the clifftop moors. About you bluffs rise, pale grey and
      dark sandstone, smooth from the sculpturing of winds, and dotted with purple heather and green mosses. A
      path strays through the clifftop hills.
