    sight: >
      This is where the rogues of Sundhaven come to gain and improve their skills of the trade. A hanging row
      of the spines of previous victims covers the east wall, scarred with the dagger twists of countless
      thieves perfecting their backstab. You may have to travel far in search of more fine-tuned skills, but
      the guildmistress is willing to give newcomers their start in the art of fiends.
