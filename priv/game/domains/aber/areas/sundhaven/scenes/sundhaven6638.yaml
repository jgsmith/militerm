    sight: >
      You are outside the town treasury, just to the west of here, making this a place bustling with activity,
      including the occasional attentions of a pickpocket or two, for the lane is broad and the shadows of the
      trees leave plenty of hiding places. However, the frequent presence of guards gives a feeling of
      security.
