    sight: >
      The corridor halts abruptly. A drop opens out at your feet, beneath which water shivers and shimmers,
      black against black. The pool is nearly still, only an occasional ripple moving across the surface gives
      any indication of life, or life in death, within. Northwards the hall disappears into the dark.
