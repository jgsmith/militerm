      Murals of black and gold adorn the walls in swirling patterns, within which are outlined several dark
      silhouettes. Under some scrutiny you can trace a basilisk, a chimera, and a dragon circling a deity, a
      dusty red cloak about her neck. Homage and sacrifice to this human deity are paid here by the other
      citizens of the realm.
