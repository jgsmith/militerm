    sight: >
      You stand amidst a tumble of rocks of various sizes and shades of grey and ebony. A pale hawk circles
      overhead, uttering a shivering cry. It is impossible to continue downwards without meeting an untimely
      (?) death. A few homes have been hidden here in the cliff face, a bit of a hike from any civilization.
