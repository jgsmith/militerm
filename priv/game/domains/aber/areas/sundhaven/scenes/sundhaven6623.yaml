    short: The southern path
    sight: >
      The green grass and firm soil of the path begin to give way to mud strewn with traces of human filth as
      you pass into the poorer section of Sundhaven. The shanties and town dump add a mild stench to the air,
      and attest to the virtual burglaries of the poor by the rich.. and often by the poor.
