    short: The Road to Cimmura
    sight: >
      The road bends here, leading north to the capital of Elenia, the city of Cimmura. You can just make out
      the towers from the royal castle in the distance. The road leading north is very well taken care of,
      after all, the Queen insists on neatness.
