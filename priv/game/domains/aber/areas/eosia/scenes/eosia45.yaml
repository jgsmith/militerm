    short: A Dark Room
    sight: >
      This dark room is filled with nothing but the sense of evil. A small stairway in front of you leads down
      into darkness. You can hear the sounds of people screaming coming from every direction. The only exits
      you can make out besides the stairs, is the archway behind you.
