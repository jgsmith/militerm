      ...is almost the size of the royal castle itself. More of a keep than a castle, the chapterhouse is the
      home of the Pandion knights in Cimmura. You stand in the main hall of the building now. All about you
      stand suits of armor, each one belonging to a famous Cimmurian Pandion. The most famous, of course, is
      Sir Sparhawk, Champion to Queen Ehlana. Knights block every exits except the one to the west.
