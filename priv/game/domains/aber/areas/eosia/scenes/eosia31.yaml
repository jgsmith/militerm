    sight: >
      You are in the Basilica of Chyrellos, the head of the whole Elene Church. From here the Archprelate
      rules with a pious hand. Gold inlay causes the light to shine and sparkle throughout the room. High
      above you a gigantic dome sparkles from the light. The mighty marble pillars that support the roof are
      decorated with colorful flowers and banners. Before you is the altar, and benchs are placed all over for
      the faithful to come and pray. Despite the wonder of the room, you still sense an ominous presence which
      makes you feel quite solemn.
