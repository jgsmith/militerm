    sight: >
      Large golden gates mark the entrance to the Royal Castle of Cimmura. The crest of Elenia is emblazed on
      each gate. Currently the castle is home to the Royal Council, ruling in Queen Ehlana's place while she
      is ill. The council has named the Prince Reagent heir and he is planning to assume the throne within the
      week. Just beyond the gates lies the main courtyard and then, the castle itself.
