    sight: >
      Your footsteps echo on the marble flooring of the castle. Massive pillars stretch up into the darkness,
      supporting the massive ceiling. Banners hang from the walls, and you think you might even recognize some
      of them. The castle has fallen into a state of decay ever since Queen Ehlana fell ill. Dust now gathers
      on the suits of armor and cobwebs can be seen in the corners. Even though you appear to be quite alone,
      you think you can see a shadow flickering just beyond the edge of your vision.
