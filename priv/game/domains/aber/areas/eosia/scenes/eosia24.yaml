    short: The Shores of Rindor
    sight: >
      You have reached the northern shores of the Kingom of Rindor. Currently, the Elene Church is trying to
      convert the heratics of the Eshandist cult back to the 'true' faith. As an Elene, perhaps it would be
      best if you left Rindor as soon as possible.
