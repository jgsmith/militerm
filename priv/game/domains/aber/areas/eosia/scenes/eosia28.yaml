    short: Styric Haven
    sight: >
      This small quaint room is a haven for Styrics who come to visit the Pandions. In order to help them in
      battle, the Church allowed the Pandions to be educated with the knowledge of magic. It was the Styrics
      who provided that education. The Lady Sephrenia was the teacher for most of the Pandions, and they hold
      her in the highest regard. This room was built to help protect the Styrics from the less tolerant Elenes
      who would rather have all Styrics killed. This simple room has a bed and table and not much else.
