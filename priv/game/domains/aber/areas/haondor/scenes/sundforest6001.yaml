    short: A Trail Through The Light Forest
    sight: >
      You are on a trail leading through the forest. There seems to be a small path leading north into the
      shadows. To the east is the forest edge and to the west the trail leads further into the forest. There
      are &+Gtrees&* all over teeming with &+Cinsects.
