    short: A Road Through The Plains
    sight: >
      You are on a dust covered east-west road through the western plains. An occasional hunter or adventurer
      can be seen, heading to or from the forest. To the east is the walled city, Sundhaven, and to the west
      the road ends at the head of a narrow trail into a large forest. To the north lies the yard of a large
      house.
