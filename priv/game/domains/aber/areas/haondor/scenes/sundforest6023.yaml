    short: A Grassy Field
    sight: >
      You are in a &+Ggrass&* covered field somewhere in the forest. The tall grass nearly reaches your waist,
      and the surrounding oaks and beeches form an almost wall-like &+Gthicket&* on the east side of the
      field. To the northeast you can see a small lake. A small path leads south through the trees, and the
      field opens up to the north and west. Several &+Cbirds&* circle in the sky.
