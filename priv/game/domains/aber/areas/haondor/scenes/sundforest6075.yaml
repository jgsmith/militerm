    short: A Shaded Path Through The Forest
    sight: >
      You are on a small shaded path leading between the trees. The forest gradually becomes more dense to the
      west, and to the northwest the terrain is quite &+Ghilly&*. The path continues north and south. To the
      east you see a trail winding through the younger section of the forest.
