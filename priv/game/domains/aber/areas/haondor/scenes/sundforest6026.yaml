    sight: >
      As you come close, scavenging &+Canimals&* and &+Cbirds&* of all sorts scatter, leaving only the boldest
      and stupidest encircling the corpse of a large boar. Carrion birds circle overhead, and smaller animals
      stare out of the tall grass at you. The &+Ggrass&* here has been trampled, and a large area around the
      corpse is stained by blood. A trail leads down the sloping field to a lake, and to the south you see the
      path back to the forest.
