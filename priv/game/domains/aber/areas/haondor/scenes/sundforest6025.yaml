    sight: >
      The &+Ggrass&* stops shortly before the &+Blake&*, replaced by mud covered in &+ytracks from the local
      animals. When you come close many animals scatter into the tall grass and some even into the forest. To
      the west you see &+Ybirds&* circling in the high in the air, and to the north you see a small lake,
      surrounded by tall reeds. The field continues to the south, and the forest blocks passage to the east.
