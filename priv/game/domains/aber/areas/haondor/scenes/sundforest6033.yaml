    short: High In The Large Oak
    sight: >
      The tree top gently sways in the wind, and you think you are as high as you can safely go in the tree.
      The limbs here show evidence of a small battle, with ripped bark and loose feathers scattered
      everywhere. Looking around, you can see the &+ywoods&* stretching out below you in all directions. To
      the east you see Sundhaven, and to the south the &+Briver&* runs through a deep chasm. North and west of
      here you can see another small village, and on the western horizon you see a large mountain. The only
      way to go from here is &+ydown.
