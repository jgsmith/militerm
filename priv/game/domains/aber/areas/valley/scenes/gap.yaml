    sight: >
      You are in a narrow rocky gap, which closes up to the south, ending in a wide arched tunnel, with a
      carved entrance. The tunnel plunges south into the mountain depths. To the north the gap widens up
      leading back out into the forest. The mountainside to the west looks as if it could be climbed.
