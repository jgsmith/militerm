      You are following a narrow winding path off the moors, leading south towards some steps. The view
      southward from here is breathtaking, as the steps are at the edge of a steep drop, giving you a superb
      vantage upon the wild misty mountains. The peaks soar high around you, walling in a wide valley. The
      lush green of the valley deep below, and the glittering of water contrast superbly with the snowy cloud
      veiled mountain tops, a stunning picture that you could contemplate for hours...
