    short: Rocky Clearing
    sight: >
      You are standing in a rocky clearing, strewn with the debris of the many landslides, which have cascaded
      down the cliffs to the south and west. To the east and north paths plunge back in amongst the trees that
      fill most of the valley. A precarious path leads over the mountain to the West.
