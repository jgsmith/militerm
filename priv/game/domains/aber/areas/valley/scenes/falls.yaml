    sight: >
      You stand in an alcove carved by wind and water into the side of a mountain. High above the ground,
      water rushes over a ledge. In a spectacular array of colors and sounds, the airborn water falls to the
      rocks below. A path leads east along the ridge rocks. There is a small pool of water among the rocks
      below you. It appears you can climb down to the pool if you're unencumbered. A natural cave echos the
      sound of bats inside to the south.
