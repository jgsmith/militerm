    sight: >
      You are standing amidst a few trees on the edge of the forest, hedged in by a sheer rock wall to the
      south, and a steep, but climbable, bank to the east. Elsewhere the forest thickens up and continues. A
      narrow path climbs along a twisty ledge along the cliff to the south.
