    sight: >
      You stand in the hall of the castle. It is furnished with a small table and chairs. On the floor there
      lies a thick carpet. The ceilings were painted white a long time ago, but have turned yellow with age.
      There are grand stairs leading &+Cup&*, and doorways to the &+Cwest&* and &+Ceast&*
