    sight: >
      You have entered a huge ballroom with crystal chandeliers and small oak &+Btables&*. Chairs are placed
      at the sides leaving the floor in the middle open for dancing. There are several paintings on the walls,
      one of which especially draws your attention. It pretends a young man battling against a big man with a
      blurred face only with his hands...as you look closer you see that he's got a big &+wwhite&* union
      between his teeth! Wonder why?
