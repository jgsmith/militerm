    short: The kitchen
    sight: >
      The kitchen is large, large enough for several cooks to work here at the same time. There is a big
      &+Bstove&* placed in the middle of the room, the walls are filled with &+Bcupboards&* and &+Bdrawers&*.
      You notice that this room has been used recently, there is no dust or filth anywhere.
