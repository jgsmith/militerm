    sight: >
      You have entered the sacred temple of the castle. Here the family of the house say their prayers. Now it
      hasn't been used for a long time and dust covers everything! But you can still see the &+Bkrusefix&* on
      the wall, and the paintings pretending the almighty God and his son Jesus. There are also some church
      &+Bbenches&* here.
