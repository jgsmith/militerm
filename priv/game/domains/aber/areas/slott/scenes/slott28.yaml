    sight: >
      This is the southeast tower...or what's left of it. The eastern wall and parts of the roof are gone; it
      had been struck by lightning and crumbled to the ground. As you look out where the wall once stood, you
      see a small garden path under the mess that the stones and wood from the tower has created.
