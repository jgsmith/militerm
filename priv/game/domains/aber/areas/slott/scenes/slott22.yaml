    sight: >
      The hallway ends abruptly, the ceiling has caved in blocking the doors to the east. As you examine
      what's left of the ceiling you see some marks as if someone has used a big sledgehammer on it. And you
      start to think that the ceiling has been deliberately made to cave in, just as if someone wouldn't let
      someone in or OUT.
