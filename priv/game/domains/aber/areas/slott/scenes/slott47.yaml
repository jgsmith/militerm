    sight: >
      The garden path continues the &+Csouth&* and to the &+Cnorth&*. Here big rocks and wood pieces fill the
      path, and as you look up at the castle tower you see why. The tower had been struck by lightning and the
      whole eastern wall and a pretty big part of the roof have fallen down to where you stand now.
