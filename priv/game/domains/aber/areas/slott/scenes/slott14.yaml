    short: Dinner Room
    sight: >
      This is where the family of the house eats their dinner. The room is big and in the middle there is a
      large &+Btable&* with six chairs around it. Along the walls there are a few cupboards and benches. The
      air smells of food, and your stomach starts to rumble.
