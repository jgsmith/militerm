      This room is even darker then the rest of the basement, and in the dim light you see a large coffin
      standing against the northern wall. At the eastern end of the room you see some &+Bfootlinks&* that are
      fastened to the floor. The western wall is filled with paintings, many of them are of landscapes painted
      in the spring.
