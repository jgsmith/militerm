    short: On The Dunes
    sight: >
      You are on the top of a high sand dune. Coarse plants grow here, harried by the wind, holding the sand
      together just enough to prevent the dunes collapsing. The beach lies to the west, the dunes continue
      north and south, and to the east lies a long-dry river delta, once a network of watercourses, now choked
      with weeds.
