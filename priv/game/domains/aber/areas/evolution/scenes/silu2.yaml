    sight: >
      Long waving fronds of seaweed brush against you as you make your way across the sea bed. You take great
      care about where you put your feet - you are only too aware of the chances of getting nipped by a
      eurypterid's pincers. To the west and south the weed is less tangled and the going looks easier.
