    sight: >
      You have reached the northern end of the forest. The ground here is a little marshy but fairly easy to
      negotiate. You can enter the forest to the south, or you can head east towards a broad lake, skirted by
      primitive cone- bearing trees. To the west and north the plant growth is unfortunately impenetrable.
