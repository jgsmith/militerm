      You are in a very deep part of the ocean. All directions look pretty much the same. Only a hazy light
      above you lets you keep your sense of direction, otherwise you would be totally lost. You notice that
      the emphasis of the large sea life has changed. Ichthyosaurs are now all but extinct, and the dominant
      marine predators are now the long-necked plesiosaurs and their cousins, the huge, short-necked
      pliosaurs. It is the pliosaurs you fear, with their large heads and bone-crushing jaws...
