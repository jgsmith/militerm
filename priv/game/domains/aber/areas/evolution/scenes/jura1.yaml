    short: Dusty Plateau
    sight: >
      You are on the top of the plateau. From here you can see for many miles in all directions. The mild
      jurassic climate warms your bones and the oxygen-rich air invigorates you. Above you soar pterosaurs,
      their large wings catching the thermals as they scan the ground for signs of fresh carrion. To the west
      the ground slopes downwards gently towards the western edge of the plateau. A path here leads down its
      southern face.
