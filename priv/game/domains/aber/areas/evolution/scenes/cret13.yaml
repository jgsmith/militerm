    short: Top Of The Dike
    sight: >
      You are standing atop a rocky natural dike, from where you can see quite a long way in all directions.
      To the west you can see, on the other side of a now-dry ancient delta, the blue line of the sea
      stretching to the horizon. To the east the ground drops into a wet bog.
