    short: Submarine Canyon
    sight: >
      You are travelling along the floor of a deep canyon in the sea bed. A warmth at your feet tells you that
      the seething molten fury of the mantle burns not far beneath you. The occasional tremor makes you rather
      nervous, and you fear that in such an age of intense volcanic activity an eruption might be imminent.
      The canyon continues to the north.
