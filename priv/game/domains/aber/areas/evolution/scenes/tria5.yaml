    sight: >
      You are on the bank of a swift-moving river, which descends a gentle slope to the south. Tall trees lean
      over the water, providing shade and a somewhat peaceful atmosphere. If you weren't in constant fear of
      attack in these parts, you could quite happily doze off to sleep here.
