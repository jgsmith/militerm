    sight: >
      As you pick your way among large boulders strewn about here, you startle a couple of lizards basking on
      a flat stone. As they disappear into a narrow crevice, a shadow falls over you, and you turn in alarm.
      You see nothing, but as you continue on your way you cannot help feeling somewhat exposed. Who knows
      what you may startle around the next corner?
