    short: On The Plain
    sight: >
      You are wandering about on the plain. The plants here are short, and the going easy, though the eocene
      scenery is dull and featureless. Trees are dotted about here and there, but apart from those and the odd
      small shrub you can see little of interest. Some way off to the south is a patch of tall bushes. A
      &+yfallen tree&* is lying here, and several egret-like birds are using it as a perch.
