    short: Tectonic Ridge
    sight: >
      You are at the foot of a steep incline leading up to a long ridge running from north-west to south-east.
      It is impossible to climb. This, you guess, must represent the boundary between two shifting continental
      plates. It seems stable enough at the moment, but you can't help feeling a certain anxiety at being so
      close to the fault.
flag:
  - soundproof
  - underwater
