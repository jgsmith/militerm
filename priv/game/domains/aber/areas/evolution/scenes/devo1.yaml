      It is an age of rapid diversification among fish. Early sharks cruise the oceans, keeping an
      ever-watchful eye out for the giant arthrodires which prey on them. Small bony fishes wisely hug the sea
      floor, keeping cover among clumps of seaweed. You feel very vulnerable as you notice all around you the
      dim shapes of prowling arthrodires, and you pray you will not be providing a meal for one of them soon.
