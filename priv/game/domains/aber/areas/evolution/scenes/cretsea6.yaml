    sight: >
      You are fairly near to the shore here. When you look east you can sea the sea floor rising up steeply to
      break the surface. However it would be unwise to proceed in that direction, since the rocks there are
      sharp and the breakers dashing themselves upon them would surely pulverize you, should you attempt a
      landing there.
