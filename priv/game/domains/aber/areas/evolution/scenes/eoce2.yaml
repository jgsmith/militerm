    short: Bank Of The Muddy River
    sight: >
      You are slipping and sliding along the bank of a meandering river which winds its way through the
      flatlands. In the middle of the river you can see the primitive forebears of elephants taking advantage
      of the plentiful water supply for washing and also for protection against the myriads of biting flies
      which are just now beginning to plague you.
