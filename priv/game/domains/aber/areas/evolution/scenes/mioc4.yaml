      Bones crackle underfoot as you step on the skeletal remains of some large grazing herbivore, whose bones
      were hidden in the tall grass. A rock formation juts out of the ground immediately to the south, and a
      large member of the cat family regards you from its summit. It yawns suddenly, revealing impossibly
      large canines, and you jump in alarm. The sabre-toothed cat has just fed, however, and has no desire to
      waste any more of its precious energy on another attack.
