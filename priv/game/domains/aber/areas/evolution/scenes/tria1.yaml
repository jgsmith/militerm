    sight: >
      This is an open patch of ground surrounded by tall tree ferns, which sway slightly in the breeze. All
      about you is the Triassic landscape, dry and hot, inhabited by thecodonts and dicynodonts and a variety
      of archosauromorphs and lepidosauromorphs. This really is the reptiles' heyday.
