    sight: >
      This is the end of the permian period. A catastrophic event is taking place: the continents of the world
      have drifted together and are even now colliding to form the supercontinent Pangaea. The effect on sea
      life is vast. Four fifths of all aquatic species are destined to disappear forever from the earth, their
      habitat destroyed by continental drift.
