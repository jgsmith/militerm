    short: Far Shore Of The Permian River
    sight: >
      You are on the far shore. The creatures you had seen from the other side do not, in fact, appear to be
      all that threatening, and most plunge into the water as you approach, or slink off into the trees.
      Probably they just do not know what to make of such a strange creature as yourself.
