    short: Northern Edge Of The Plateau
    sight: >
      The plateau ends abruptly just to the north of you, and as you peer over the edge your stomach churns at
      the sight of a sheer cliff dropping five hundred feet to the valley floor. Descent here would be
      suicide. You can however continue to wander the plateau to the south, east and west.
