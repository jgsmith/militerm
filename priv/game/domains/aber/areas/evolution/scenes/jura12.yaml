    short: Edge Of The Forest
    sight: >
      You are at the northern edge of the forest. To the south the trees tower over you, hundreds of feet
      tall. The forest floor is uncluttered by undergrowth, but the leaf litter is very thick and springy
      under your feet, making your progress very pleasant. To the north is a broad lake.
