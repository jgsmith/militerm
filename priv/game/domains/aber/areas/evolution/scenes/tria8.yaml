    sight: >
      Primitive pine trees abound here. Monkey Puzzles are the dominant variety, although you can also see
      several other types. To the north an imposing plateau rises into the sky, and you can make out a path
      leading up to the top which does not look too difficult. To the east tree ferns take over as the most
      common form of plant life.
