    short: Lycopod Swamp
    sight: >
      You are lost in the swamp. Your feet sink into the marshy ground up to your knees and your progress is
      slow. The trunks of enormous Sigillaria and Lepidodendron trees are all around you, and through the gaps
      between them you strain to see daylight. But all you spy are more trees. This is a beautiful place, but
      you are quickly becoming tired of it. You can go in any direction from here.
