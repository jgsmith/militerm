    sight: >
      You are in a valley in the lower cretaceous. Early flowering plants and deciduous trees are beginning to
      appear here, thriving in the large areas of deforestation left by browsing sauropods. To the west is a
      forest of more primitive trees, and to the north is a peaceful-looking meadow.
