    short: Thorny Bank
    sight: >
      You are scrambling through bushes halfway up a steep slope. Sharp thorns tear at your clothing and you
      curse as they draw blood. Below you the bushes end as the ground flattens off in a wide marsh, shaded by
      tall broad-leaved trees. Above you is the top of the bank.
