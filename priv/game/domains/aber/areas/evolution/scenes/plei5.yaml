    short: Painted Cave
    sight: >
      You are inside the cave. Crude paintings adorn the walls, and you can't help wondering if you have
      entered somebody's home. The paintings are mostly of animals: buffalo, zebra and so on, and there are
      also depictions of what can only be humans with spears.
