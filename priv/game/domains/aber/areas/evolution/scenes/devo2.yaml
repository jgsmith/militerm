    sight: >
      You are lost, alone and vulnerable, swimming about in a forgotten ocean, at the mercy of arthrodires,
      giant armoured fish with crushing jaws filled with jagged bone plates which serve (very effectively) in
      place of teeth. You search in vain for a glimpse of the shore.
