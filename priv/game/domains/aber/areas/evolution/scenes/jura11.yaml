      These are the foothills to the north of the jurassic plateau. The cliff wall to the south is too steep
      to climb, but perhaps you could find an easier path to the top by going west from here. To the north, in
      a flat patch of ground, is a tar pit containing a doomed ornithopod, and to the east lies a forest of
      redwoods.
