    sight: >
      You are wandering among some delightful scenery. Gentle hills and dales rise and fall about you, and
      rivers and streams meander through them without hurry. Only the unearthly cries of far-off dinosaurs
      remind you that you are not strolling through the hills of the holocene epoch. To the west a path heads
      north towards rockier ground.
