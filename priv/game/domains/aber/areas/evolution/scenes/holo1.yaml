    sight: >
      You are in a well-hewn but cold corridor. Hanging from the walls are rows of well-made torches, and you
      guess that whoever put them there was not the same as the person that drew the cave paintings to the
      south. This is definitely the holocene epoch. You have reached the present day at last. To the west the
      lights end, and you see a dark cave stretching away for some distance.
