    sight: >
      The palace does not seem the same as it was the last time you were here. You can feel Jafar's evil
      presence all around you. He should know you have returned. You can expect a nice welcome party awaiting
      you throughout the castle. Halls lead to the east and south. There is a gate behind you, well, you are
      stuck.
