      This area of the city is bare of all trees. On the contrary, the edifices here are well-built and offer
      excellent shelter. Many dead bodies lay about, among them both naked ones and well-equipped ones. The
      naked ones have apparently been killed by weapons from the well-equipped beings. The well-equipped
      bodies have obviously been slain by primitive tools and weapons. There is but a single living being
      here. A lonely, blood-stricken road leads east into the City.
