    short: The City of Rivendell
    sight: >
      The marvel of this city's architecture only increases as your eyes get closer to it. The homes all about
      you are shaped, not built from the wood of the trees, and are thus part of them. Sunlight is captured
      beautifully by a crystal arch spanning the entire city from your left to right, and it is focused
      miraculously into one spot in the center of the city. All around you are numerous elven dwellings. Yet
      the city seems oddly quiet for so large an area, and so merry a people... You see numerous destroyed
      musical instruments littering the streets; lyres with broken strings, recorders and flutes with
      shattered bodies, and drums with broken heads. There is a door to your right, leading to a large elven
      home, and a large threshold to your left. The city continues on to the north.
