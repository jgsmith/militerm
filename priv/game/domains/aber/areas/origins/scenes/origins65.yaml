    short: Mount Olympus
    sight: >
      You have arrived at the home of the Gods themselves. Here is the place where the Immortals live,
      untouched by the petty, trivial grievances of mere mortals. You can see the whole world from this
      awesome vantage. You are indeed invincible here. All that you could ever hope for can be found, and even
      then there is some left over... You look down from Olympus on a world of doubt and fear. Its surface is
      splintered into sorry hemispheres. But suddenly, the very elven music you helped save issues forth from
      your love and wisdom. The chaos below ceases, and the people stop fighting, somehow awestruck by its
      beauty. Apollo and Dionysus turn to you and say '&+WWe shall call you Cygnus, &+gthe Bringer of
      &+GBalance!&+W We now see that only through a balance of both Truth &+Wand Love can the miracle of life
      succeed. And this beautiful music is its &+Wbackbone... Now, dear Bringer of Balance, if you wish to
      leave us, simply &+Wcast away your fears and jump.&n'
