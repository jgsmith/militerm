      You wake up, your bones feeling like jelly and your heart beating a mile a minute. You look around for
      your brave captain Neil Peart, but he is nowhere to be found... The road you stand on is very wide, and
      directly ahead of you, yet miles away still, is a very, very large mountain. You can follow this road
      north only, but for many miles.
