    sight: >
      You lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, a vast sea of unbroken
      grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the sky. You see various people
      'plugging' into their machines, and carrying Temple Papers. From here, you may choose to walk in any
      direction. To the north lie clearly the most important buildings here; huge, metallic structures which
      form a small town of their own and easily dominates the view for miles. To the south lies the spaceport,
      where large vehicles capable of flight arrive and depart regularly. To the east is another large
      edifice, and people are bustling in and out of there hurriedly. Finally, to the west, is the single
      place of residence you can recognize. It reminds you of familiar houses at home, except that it is made
      of metal.
