    short: The Top of the Stairs
    sight: >
      You climb the long flight of steps, heading toward the zenith, and the climb is a long and tedious one.
      The stairs squeak loudly as you tread upon them. You pray that the fragile stairs don't crumble
      underneath your feet. As you reach the top, you see a door. Optionally, you may head back down the
      stairs.
