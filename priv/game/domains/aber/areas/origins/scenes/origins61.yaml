      You enter a large, forested area of the City, where naked beings of all races frolick about, care-free
      and worry-free. Many dead bodies lay about, among them both naked ones and well-equipped ones. The naked
      dead ones appear to have fallen victim to starvation, cold, and wolves, while a few have apparently been
      killed by weapons from the well-equipped beings. The well-equipped bodies have obviously been slain by
      primitive tools and weapons. A single path leads west back to the City.
