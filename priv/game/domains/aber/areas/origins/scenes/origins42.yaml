      Upon entering this room, you feel like you are going to faint, due to the plethora of bright lights and
      noise. The source of most of the light is row upon row upon row of large screens, to which many people
      are attached. The images seem quite amorphous to you, but the people using them probably see a whole new
      world... A single western exit heads back out to Megadon.
