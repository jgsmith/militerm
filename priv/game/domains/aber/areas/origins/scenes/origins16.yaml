    sight: >
      The light from the staff increases in magnitude until all you can see is a blinding white light and all
      you can hear in your head are the words 'Draw towards the fountain'. But soon the sound dies down and
      the light gives way to a most soothing and pastoral scene. You stand high atop a mountain, overlooking a
      vast ocean to the west and a beautiful sylvan forest in all other directions. The sheer natural beauty
      of this place, so pure and relaxing it is, has you in a total state of relaxation. From here, you can
      see the whole world it seems, and you feel invincible, almost immortal... Above you and slightly to the
      east, you hear the sounds of running water, and a mysterious, sultry voice beckons to you. "Come up,"
      the voice soothes.
