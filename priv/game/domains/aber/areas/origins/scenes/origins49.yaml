    sight: >
      You enter the heart of the great Spaceport, and come face to face with the large flying objects, which
      you overhear the people refer to as 'spaceships'. Many people embark and disembark from these ships
      before your eyes. Most of the ships are huge, but one particularly small one dubbed "The Rocinante"
      catches your eye. There is a man at that ship, who gestures for you to go see him. It would also be
      possible for you to head back up north toward Megadon.
