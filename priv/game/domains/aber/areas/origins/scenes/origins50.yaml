      You follow the man, and climb up into the ship. Before your eyes are huge panels on all four walls,
      filled with buttons and lights you don't understand. The entire interior of the ship humms slightly, and
      you can feel these subtle vibrations. They tickle you. The man seems to understand your need to get
      home. You have one last chance to go back down, or you may press forward and follow his lead.
