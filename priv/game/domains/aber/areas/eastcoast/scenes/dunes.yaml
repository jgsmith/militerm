    short: Sandy Dunes
    sight: >
      You stand along a ridge of sandy dunes that run parallel to the beach that lies to the east, the waves
      of the sea crashing in where the beach breakers fail to cover, and apparently on a sand shoal resting
      some hundred feet from shore as well. From this vantage, you spy to the north a long wall of cliffs, and
      in front of that to the west, a dark green-black mass that is only known as the Swamps of Peril. To the
      south, you observe a long beach leading back to a small set of docks. The sides of the dunes appear too
      steep to climb back down except for the west side and a quick tumble down toward a line of wave breaking
      rocks.
