    short: Mouth of the Stream
    sight: >
      At this part of the beach, you see a stream come in from the west and empty its dark and rancid waters
      into the sea, and you get a strange feeling that the waters of the sea feel repulsed at what is emptying
      into it from the stream. Few if any plants seem to conglomerate at the stream's edge, and how sickly and
      twisted the ones are that live there. You can follow the shoreline to the north, to a more welcoming
      beach, or follow the stream to the west, or you can try crossing the stream here and approach a line of
      wave-breaking rocks that lie nearby to the south.
