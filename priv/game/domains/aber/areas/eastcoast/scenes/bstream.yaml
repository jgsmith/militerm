    sight: >
      Walking on a grassy bank, you peer into an east-west running stream as it drains out of a dreary looking
      swamp to the west. The water, instead of containing the vibrant life of plants and water life, bears the
      smelly slimes, fetid algae, and uncleanliness of whatever dwells from within the dark swamp, causing
      your nose to wrinkle. The stream looks no more than waist-deep, but any travel to the south bank appears
      futile, with a formidable wall of thorny bramble bushes to meet you there. More hopeful paths lie to the
      east, where the stream thins out into the sea, and to the north across a grassy field. To the west, you
      see another, less traveled path following the stream toward the edge of the swamp itself. Such feelings
      leave you to think that travelling into the swamp would not be a good idea.
