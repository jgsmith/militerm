    sight: >
      At least three hundred feet below you stand jagged rocks, deadly spires of teeth that could kill any who
      are foolhardy enough to jump from here. Even if a lucky soul were to miss the rocks, then surely the
      waves will be the end of them, crashing and whipping into the rocks with uncontrolled fury. Safer
      grounds lie to the west, where a haze of yellow brilliance arises, and to the south toward a high point
      at the cliff's end, but a thrill-seeking trail cuts a rut into the cliff face to the rocks below for
      those that are not too encumbered.
