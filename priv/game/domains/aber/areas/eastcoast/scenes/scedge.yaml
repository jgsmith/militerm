    sight: >
      You are standing next to the edge of a cliff overlooking the swamplands lying to the south. Fortunately
      (?) for you, a fence of questionable quality stands between you and the slim chance of survival in the
      chances of falling. Safer travels lie to the north, towards a flat field where sounds of bleating sheep
      originate, and to the west you can follow the cliff's edge.
