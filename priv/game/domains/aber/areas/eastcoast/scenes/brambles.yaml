      You are beating your way through a dense clump of thorny foliage, and think that this was not really the
      best idea, since the plants seem to have a mind of their own and appear to tear into your exposed flesh
      whenever you think you've moved it out of the way, or prick you in the most sensitive areas. Safer ways
      of travel lie to the east and south, but to the north and east, you might just be able to escape the
      thorny overgrowth by plunging on through headlong.
