    short: North End of the Sand Shoal
    sight: >
      You walk to the north end of the shoal, the salty water mere inches deep here. The shoal breaks the
      waves up here, making them less fierce against the beach that lies some eighty feet to the west. You see
      various fish and marine life being washed along by the waves, and some larger aquatic denizens making
      waves of their own. The water appears too treacherous and deep in all directions save to the south.
