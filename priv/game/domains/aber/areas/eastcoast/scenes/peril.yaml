    sight: >
      This area appears to be the only break in the brambles and dense and twisted vegetation to allow
      entrance eastward into the swamp, at least for those that are brave and staunch enough to venture
      further. You hear strange sounds coming from inside the swamp, making your blood cold. The stream here
      smells fetid and vile, as if foul substances were dumped into it. You would feel much more comfortable
      if you headed back east along the stream.
