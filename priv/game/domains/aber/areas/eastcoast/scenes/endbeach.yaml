    sight: >
      Mist condenses on your face as you gaze upon the frothy waters around you. Not much can be seen of the
      sea, with all the mist and the tall jagged rocks, some towering fifteen feet in the air. Turning around
      you see a virtually unclimbable cliff, save for a crack that runs up diagonally along the face. The
      beach continues to the south.
