    sight: >
      You feel little comfort here as the path lies mere feet from the first of the swampland trees, unearthly
      twisted representations of plants, giving you a feeling of hopeless despair. The path looks even more
      dreary to the west as it slopes gradually down to the level of the swamps itself, but a more promising
      path lies upwards to the east, where there appears to be a cavemouth in the tall cliff face.
