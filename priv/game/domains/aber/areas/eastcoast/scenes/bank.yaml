      You precariously stand on a slanted rock here, overlooking the beach nearby. Waves crash around the
      rocks here, spraying them and you with cold water, and making the rocks increasingly slippery, making
      even walking a telling task, let alone anything more theatrical. To the north you spy another row of
      rocks, and to the south, you see a small dock jut into the water. The only survivable way out of here
      appears to be back along the wet rocks to the west.
