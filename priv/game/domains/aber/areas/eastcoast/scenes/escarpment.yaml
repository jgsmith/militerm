    sight: >
      You are standing at a drier spot in the swamplands, seemingly impervious to the thick plant growth.
      Looking around, you see that most of the ground here consists of hard rocks and pebbles that have fallen
      down from a nearby gully up the cliff, making it hard for plants to root in. A path hugs the cliff, but
      still uncomfortably close to the swamps to the east, which for some strange reason makes your skin
      crawl. A break in the twisted trees lie to the south, and it looks as if you could scrabble through the
      pebbles up the side of the escarpment.
