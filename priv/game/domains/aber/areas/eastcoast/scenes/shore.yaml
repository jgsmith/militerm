    short: Narrow Shore
    sight: >
      This part of the shore narrows to the point where the distance between the surf to the west and the
      sheer face of the cliff looming overhead to the east is only a scant few feet, and occasionally you need
      to walk in ankle-deep water just to continue. To the north and the south are walkable stretches of beach
      while the waters to the east offer little more than a watery grave.
