    sight: >
      Standing to your knees in cool and refreshing water, you feel relaxed from the toils and rigors of the
      land, and you inhale the invigorating sea- scented air blowing in from the sea. At your feet underwater,
      you see through the ripples many colorful corals, starfish, mollusks, and other marine life. Large rocks
      ring the waters here, breaking the waves of the sea beyond. A small space in the rocks would let a boat
      through. The beach lies to the west.
