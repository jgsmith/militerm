    sight: >
      With water up to your waist here, you feel tingles run up your spine from the contact with the cool and
      refreshing sea water. A brisk breeze blows in from the sea, tinged with salt. Gulls and other sea-faring
      birds fly overhead, circling and turning in some strange dance of the sea. Not too far away to the
      south, you spy a jetty poking its way into the wavy waters. Noticing the shallow waves, you see the
      cause in the form of a sand shoal to the east. Unfortunately, the water gets too deep before you could
      get to it without special means. Looking for exits, you see a way back to the beach to the west, and it
      also seems possible to walk north, following the shallow waters.
