    short: Crevasse
    sight: >
      You are standing on the edge of a deep crevasse looking down into darkness. Heavy snow is piled all
      around you, partially hiding the distant mountains. The snows extend in all direction save east, where
      the crevasse bars the route. You could clamber down into the crevasse but would have great problems in
      getting back out of it.
