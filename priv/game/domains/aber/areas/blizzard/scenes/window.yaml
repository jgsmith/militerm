    sight: >
      You are hanging onto a fairly precipitous cliff, beside a rocky window. Far below you can see the pass
      which seems to sway backwards and forwards as the icy wind tries to tear you away from the cliff and
      lashes you with huge clouds of blinding snow. The window is west.
