      A shopkeeper behind the desk is peddling his wares. Along the walls of this small room are grains,
      herbs, fruits, and many assorted apparatuses of unknown use. The shopkeeper smiles at you, and says:
      "Feel free to browse here. There are many things for sale, which you can learn more about by typing
      'buy'. Otherwise, type 'buy <item>'"
