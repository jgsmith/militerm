    sight: >
      You are in a huge pillared hall deep within the mountain. Huge, ornately carved pillars support the
      millions of tons of rock above you. Sinister and rather ugly gargoyles protrude from the pillars gazing
      centrally towards a mass of mystical symbols engraved on the floor.
