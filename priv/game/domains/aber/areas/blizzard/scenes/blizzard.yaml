    sight: >
      You are stumbling along the side of the mountain, exposed to the elements which at most times of the
      year sweep this area clear of debris. To the south- west the slope is almost sheer, while to the east a
      deep accumulation of snow is scarred by a deep crevasse. The snows extend in all other directions save
      north, where a lighted inn offers warmth, food, and shelter from the elements.
