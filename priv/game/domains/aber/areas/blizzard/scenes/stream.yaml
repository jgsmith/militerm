    sight: >
      You stand on a quiet grassy stream bank. The water burbles gently past you, shaded by the thick trees
      and bushes which grow along the bank. Towering oaks cast dark rippling shadows across the almost
      mirrorlike rippling water which flickers in the light. The undergrowth blocks any way southwards along
      the stream, but thins out to the north and west where paths lead off.
