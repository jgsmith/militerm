    short: Glittering Cave
    sight: >
      You are in a huge glittering cave. Millions of tiny crystals on the wall scintilate with rainbows of
      colors baffling your eyes and mind with a stunning mass of changing color. A set of huge steps lead
      upwards out of the cave, but only a giant could hope to climb them.
