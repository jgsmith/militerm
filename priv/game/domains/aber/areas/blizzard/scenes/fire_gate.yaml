      You are in a large rocky and very uneven cave. A smooth path has been cut across the floor permitting
      easy walking. The whole cave is filled with a thundering roar which reaches deep into your mind. A huge,
      deep and steep- walled channel full of lava prevents you from going east through a huge gateway.
