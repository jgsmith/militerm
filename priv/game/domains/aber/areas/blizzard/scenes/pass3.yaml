    sight: >
      You are scrabbling for a firm footing on the side of a steep scree slope. With a lot of effort you could
      probably make it to the top, but a far easier route would be south back down the path. In your effort to
      stay upright you almost fail to notice a narrow ravine leading eastwards.
