    short: The Humpbacked Bridge
    sight: >
      You are standing on a crumbling humpbacked bridge looking over the side down onto a wide but shallow
      stream. The sun sparkles gently off the ripples as the stream passes across pebbles and rocks and the
      fish swim between them. You hear the faint roar of a waterfall somewhere downstream. You can go east or
      west across the bridge or follow the stream southwards.
