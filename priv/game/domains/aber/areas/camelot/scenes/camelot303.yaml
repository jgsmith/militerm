      This room was obviously designed with one thing in mind. Pleasure. The walls are of white marble, and
      the floor is covered by a thick white rug, made from some sort of fur. The draperies over the windows
      are red, and give a warm glow to the rest of the room. The single item of furniture takes up almost all
      available floor space.
