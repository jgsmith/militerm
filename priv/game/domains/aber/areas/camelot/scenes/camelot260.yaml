    short: The Great Hall
    sight: >
      You walk down the wide hall, amazed. The walls are paneled with walnut, and on the walls hang paintings.
      Looking at them, you see pictures of Merlin, Rapture, and all their closest friends. The northern wall
      is dominated by a painting showing their marriage.
