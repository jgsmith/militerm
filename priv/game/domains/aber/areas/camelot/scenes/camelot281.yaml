      The entire south and west walls of this room are transparent. But oddly, when you looked at the Keep
      from outside, they seemed to be made of solid stone. The floor is covered by a thick carpet, and the
      room is filled with rare flowering plants. There are several lounge chairs around the room, and on a
      small table by one is a vase of white roses.
