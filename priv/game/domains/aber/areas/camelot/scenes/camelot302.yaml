    sight: >
      The furniture in this room seems to be slightly less opulent then in other parts of the Keep, as if it
      was selected more for comfort then for style or appearances. A large stone fireplace is set into the
      north wall, and the furniture is arranged around it, so that all guests will be comfortable and at a
      conversational distance.
