    sight: >
      Before you stands the legendary round table of King Arthur. Behind each of the chairs hangs a portrait
      of an honored Knight. Looking at the portraits, you can see honor and chivalry in their eyes. All but
      one. The painting of Mordred is as realistic as the others, and from his eyes you see only a cold
      calculating evil.
