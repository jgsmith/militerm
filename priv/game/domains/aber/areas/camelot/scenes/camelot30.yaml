    short: Forest Path
    sight: >
      Your wanderings have brought you to a wilder place in the garden. The path continues in all directions.
      To the north you spy a gateway, to the east, a lovely gazebo. South lies the garden, and eventually,
      Camelot itself. To the west is a deep dense forest.
