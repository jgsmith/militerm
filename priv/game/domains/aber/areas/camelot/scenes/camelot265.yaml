    short: The Sitting Room
    sight: >
      This large, plush room is used as a place to sit in the quiet and meet with visitors. There is a sense
      of quiet, of privacy, that makes you feel quite comfortable. The floor is heavily carpeted, and your
      steps make no sound. And no sounds penetrate from the world outside either.
