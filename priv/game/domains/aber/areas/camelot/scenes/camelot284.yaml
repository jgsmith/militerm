      This is where Merlin comes for privacy when he needs to build some new trap for mortals who invade his
      home. The walls are covered with maps of all of AberMUD, with notations on them describing the various
      traps and puzzles, and their solutions. A large table fills the floor, and is covered with maps and
      diagrams for areas that are currently under construction.
