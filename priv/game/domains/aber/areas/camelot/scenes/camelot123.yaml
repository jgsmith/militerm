    sight: >
      The small cave you have entered is about half full of rubble. It seems to be piled primarily in north
      end of the room. A bit of looking explains why. There is an opening in that wall, and from the looks of
      things, the rubble has been piled here in a rather simple minded attempt to conceal the opening.
