      You are in a comfortable looking waiting area. There are several soft chairs placed about the room.
      Along the south wall, below the windows, there is a table set with a number of trays bearing food and
      drink of various sorts. The northern wall is dominated by a fireplace, which looks quite large enough to
      keep the room warm, even in the coldest weather.
