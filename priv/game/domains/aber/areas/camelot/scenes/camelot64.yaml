    short: Blacksmith Shop
    sight: >
      You are in a tiny blacksmith shop, where you can have a pot mended, a horse shod, or a blade mended.
      Heavy hammers and tongs hang from the walls, and a fire roars in the forge. Steam rises from the barrel
      being used to quench the metals as they come out of the forge.
