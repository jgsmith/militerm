    sight: >
      You are in what could easily be the most luxurious bathing room you have ever heard of. The walls and
      floor are of white marble. The floor is warmed to a comfortable tempurature by some magic. In the center
      of the room is a huge sunken tub. Water flows continually in and out of it, and the steam rising from it
      makes you long to immerse yourself. Along the western side of the tub is a shelf holding bottles of
      various soaps, oils, and lotions. A small stand holds a stack of thick, soft towels.
