    short: A Decaying Room
    sight: >
      You stand in a decaying room, the stone walls and floor are soaked with damp and whatever used to be
      stored in here has long since rotted away. The timbers of the roof above you now sag dangerously and the
      whole room smells of rot. A single doorway leads west.
