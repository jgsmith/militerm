    sight: >
      You are climbing a set of steep, slippery stairs that lead up into the church tower. Water runs down the
      steps, collecting in mossy pools, where the cracks and dips in the stonework allow it. The steps turn
      from stone to wood up above, and look very rickety. To the west a doorway leads out into the pulpit.
