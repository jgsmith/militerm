      The heaviness and darkness of this grave is so prevalent that even during the middle of the day you need
      a light to see. The mound here is overgrown with weeds and the tombstone is old and uncared for. The
      stone, although aged and cracked, is readable, and says: Do you know that it hurts? Yet this is their
      reward? Do you feel my pain? Tied up in anguish? Can you understand my meaning, What example is this, My
      reason for what I do? That they do not understand? In the end I failed, At what I most loved, Hurting
      them, I care. 					-Pooka
