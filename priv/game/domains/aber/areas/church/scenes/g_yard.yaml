    sight: >
      You are standing at the southern end of the graveyard, following a path which leads north, beside a
      stone wall. To the south is the churchyard, and the old church itself. To the west a worn rut in the
      grass leads out across some marshy ground, past a sign which reads "Danger Marshland". A small grave
      bears the enscription "Orcus: He wasn't nice and paid the price."
