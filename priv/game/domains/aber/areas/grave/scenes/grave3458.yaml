      Here is a large room that has benches that face an instruction board. On the board you see a map of part
      of the church. The map indicates which area this 'group' of soldiers are to capture and hold. A leader
      of the group stands in front of the board with a mischevious smile. As you enter the room the smile
      turns to terror and he screams at you with hate. For your own safety you could return north.
