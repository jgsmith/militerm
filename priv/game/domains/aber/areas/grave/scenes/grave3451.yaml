    sight: >
      Here is the final rally point for the undead hordes that overran the church. Laying in scattered piles
      are maps, discarded equipment, and written instructions on the attack upon the church. The room is very
      large and it is apparent that whoever planned the attack dispatched a great many warriors to sacrifice
      themselves, so others behind them may be succesful. The smells that overcome you are from the evil
      beings bent on destruction. There are exits up, north and south.
