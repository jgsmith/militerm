    sight: >
      Here is where the priest kept his robes, crowns and other instuments of the priesthood. You notice on
      the wall a map that has been ripped making it unreadable. The closet otherwise is empty, but you feel
      great power and strength coming - or used to come from this room. The only exit is to the east.
