    short: The Foyer
    sight: >
      Here is the foyer of the grand church of the GOD of ATOR. The foyer is large and at one time ornately
      decorated with religous symbols. Now the foyer has been severly shredded with unspeakable evil. On the
      west wall still visible is a painting of an old man. While the painting has been shredded you can still
      make out the likeness of on old man you seem to recognize. He has a white beard and very wise, forgiving
      eyes that seem to pierce you soul. You almost notice a tear in his eye. Below the painting is a book or
      rather what once was a &+Cregistry&*. To the north you may leave the church, or to the east you may
      visit the classrooms of ATOR. Or to the South you may visit the grand cathedral.
