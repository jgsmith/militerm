    sight: >
      Here is a schoolroom that has only recently been converted to a different, very evil type of religion.
      There are drawings, pictures, and writings that you find pleasing and comforting that are in disarray
      and being torn to shreds while being replaced by images of things that will do you great harm. You fight
      the feeling of upset and try to hold your lunch down. For your own safety you better exit back north.
