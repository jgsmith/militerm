      The room here is used as a place where troops gather to await the assault. Instructions for the assualt
      and capture are posted on a board which stands in one corner of the room. The troops that gathered here
      were wipped into a killing frenzy as there are signs of slash and stab marks on the benches that face
      the board. There is an exit to the west.
