    short: &+YThe Altar of ATOR
    sight: >
      Here is the altar of ATOR. The altar itself is hacked, broken, charred, severely desecrated. The marble
      the altar was made of has broken off into chunks and fallen onto the floor. The stench here is more
      overpowering than ever before and you choke to breathe. But what is most amazing is the statue that
      stands upon the altar. The statue is of the likeness of the old man you saw in the picture in the foyer.
      The statue glows with a faint light and has been obviously untouched. As you move you hand to touch the
      statue a voice in your mind forces you to withdraw. You can readily see what has kept this statue free
      from all harm - the blessings of the god himself. You begin to realize that whatever protects this
      statue may reward you for defeating the evil that conquered this holy place. There are exits to the
      north, east, south, and west.
