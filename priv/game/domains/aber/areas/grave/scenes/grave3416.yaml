    short: The Garden
    sight: >
      There is a large garden here that at one time looked to be very peaceful and a place to commune with the
      god of your choice. Now the ground is overgrown with thorn bushes and vines making for a dark, rank
      smelling place. The apple trees that once grew here are dead with many branches lying scattered along
      the ground. You notice in one corner of the garden a hole, recently dug. When you move closer to the
      hole you shiver to think what must be down there.
