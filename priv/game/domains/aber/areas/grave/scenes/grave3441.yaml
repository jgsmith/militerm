      Standing before you is a massive &+Yorgan&*. The organ is still impressive despite the pounding it has
      taken at the hands of the intruders. Finely polished and ingraved wood are meticulous in construction as
      the organ surrounds itself on three sides the organ player. The keyboards are multi-leveled and the
      footpedals are multi tiered. The pipes are most impressive as the surround and blend into the walls
      around this immense room. However sitting at the organ appears to be your worst nightmare.
