      Centered squarely in this room is a &+Ythrone&*. Made of gold and silver the throne is exquisitely
      decorated with gems and jewels. On the &+Ythrone&* sits a large grinning devil which smiles and motions
      you closer. You feel compelled to obey as as you step up to the throne his smile deepens. Your coming
      was foreseen - even watched. But now, finally...... YOU MUST DIE!
