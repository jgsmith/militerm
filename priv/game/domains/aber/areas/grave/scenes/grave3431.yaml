    sight: >
      You are in the right side of the back of the church. The stench is strong. There is a corpse here hacked
      to pieces by the conquerors of the church. You just hope there are not others that met the same fate but
      your sixth sense tells you otherwise. A little light filters in through the window here that has been
      shattered and is lying in small pieces of glass on the floor. You can exit to the west.
