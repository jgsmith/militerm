    short: Behind The Altar
    sight: >
      This is a small area immediately behind the altar. There is evidence of a great battle here. The floor
      is charred and there are broken weapons, scraps of cloth, cracked helmets, and many corpses. You are
      very surprised to see the corpses belong to what looks like the invaders and there is no sign of any
      dead church members. You are very puzzled what this may mean. The obvious exits are to the north and
      west.
