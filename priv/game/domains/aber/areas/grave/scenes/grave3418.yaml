    short: End of the Hallway
    sight: >
      Here is the end of the hallway. It still smells very bad and looking at the floor and walls you see the
      works of the evil beings have been very productive for them. There are doors north and south which are
      obviously classrooms and a door to the east. Or you could take the safe path and exit west leading to
      the hallway.
