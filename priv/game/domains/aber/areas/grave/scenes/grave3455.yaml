      This room has no furnishings whatsoever. The room is very large and from the center you can barely see
      the walls with this reduced lighting. As you move closer to the walls you see scratched patrol A patrol
      B patrol C, etc. This room is very clean but as you look around you see a few weapons of war that have
      been left behind. There is an exit west.
