      As you enter the room here the first you notice is a long tunnel that angles down at a severe angle into
      the hel of below. To the south is a large pool of water, and anchored on the shore is a very large
      barge. The barge is secured so thoroughly, you have no chance of making use of it. The floor here is
      well worn as a great many people, or things have passed here.
