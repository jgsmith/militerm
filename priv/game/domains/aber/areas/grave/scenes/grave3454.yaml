      Many benches line the walls and the middle of the room. In one corner is a large board with a drawing of
      an old man with the name ATOR on the back of his robe. An arrow points to him with the word ALIVE
      printed very plainly next to it. You finally realize that the attack on the church was not to destroy it
      but to capture the old man. And the attackers that gathered here had this as there goal. These attackers
      must have been very grim and determined and you now know they were succesful. There is an exit west.
