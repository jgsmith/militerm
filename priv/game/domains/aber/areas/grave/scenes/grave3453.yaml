    sight: >
      Here is a large hallway that connects several 'holding rooms' to the entrance beneath the church. The
      hallway has had much activity as you see broken weapons of all kinds discarded on the floor. There are
      hastily drawn maps on the walls that indicate further instructions to the invaders. There are exits
      north, south, east, and west.
