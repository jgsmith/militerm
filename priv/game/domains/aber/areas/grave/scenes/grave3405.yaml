    short: On the steps of the Old Church
    sight: >
      You are standing on the steps of an old church. The church looks very old and is in decay. You have the
      impression that the church is not nearly what is used to be, as you have the distinct feeling that evil
      now lies within. It is very quiet here. There is a massive wooden door south. The door has been
      desecrated with unknown markings. You can peek through the &+Cglass&* or check out the &+ybenches.
