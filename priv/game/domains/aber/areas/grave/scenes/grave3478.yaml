      As soon as you step into this room the door behind slams shut and disappears. The only way back to the
      safety of the surface is now down rather than the way you came. After looking around the room you
      suddenly hear a loud, hideous laugh that echoes along the walls. You cannot tell from where the source
      of the laugh is but you are sure it did come from behind you. The only exit now is to the west.
