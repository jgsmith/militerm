    sight: >
      You stand in the very center of the massive cathedral. The light here is very weak, but can see the
      ceiling which towers several meters above your head. The timbers holding the church upright are huge and
      ornately carved and appear to have been assembled a long time ago to stand up to the passing times. The
      floor is polished oak that was built by hands of caring. The pews here appear to be made of the same
      strong oak while the velvet cushions are ripped to shreds. The stench is very strong and you think you
      may really loose your lunch before you can find your way to the next rooms. There are exits to the
      north, east, south, and west.
