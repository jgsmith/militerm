      The room here is several large wooden benches all facing a large board. On the board you see a map of
      the church above with checkpoints drawn on the map. You can tell the attack was well organized and would
      overwhelm the peaceful church. Written under the map you can make out the words TAKE ONLY ONE PRISONER.
      At that your heartbeat quickens when you know that there might be someone left alive. There is an exit
      to the east.
