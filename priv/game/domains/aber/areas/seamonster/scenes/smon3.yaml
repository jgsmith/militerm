    sight: >
      You are standing on a small island. It is merely a huge rock poking out from the sea with no trees, no
      sand, nothing. As you look around, the waves pound the north and south sides. To the east the water is a
      bit streamy, but the rocks are very sharp on that side and you could hurt yourself. It seems so that the
      only way out here is the way back.
