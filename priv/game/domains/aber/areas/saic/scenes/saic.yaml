      This is the room where the evil god, Saic, live. Like you could expect from any evil god, dead bodies
      are lying around and blood flows into a gigantic blood pool. Saic exerce his evil influence in total
      silence. Not a word, not a sound. If I were you, I would suggest to be nice, because Saic sure doesn't
      seem in a good mood. The only exit is west of here.
