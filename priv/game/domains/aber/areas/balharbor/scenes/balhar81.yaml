    sight: >
      You run into the water defying the demands of a few hundred beach brats on your tail with a few hundred
      beach brats approaching you from the water. It seems you may have to fight with physical force for your
      right to have a day at the beach. You can either run back into the crowd to a certain confrontation to
      the north or swim to an approaching boat to the south and fight with security. The water extends itself
      forever east and west.
