    sight: >
      ...and now turn the camera to this section outside town where you have seemingly ended up on this
      beach...not just any beach, but Yllythad Beach. Beach goers notice that you are a stranger here and
      approach you yelling and screaming that you are trespassing here demanding you get lost. You better
      leave this beach back upward to the dock before they all kick sand in your face and drag you off by your
      feet or you can jump in the water and try to swim away from them to the south. The beach extends itself
      for as far as the eye can see from the east and west.
