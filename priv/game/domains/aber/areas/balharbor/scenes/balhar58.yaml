      You stand in front of the Second National Bank. The First National Bank that was here before was the
      victim of a major bank heist in which after the place was looted, the place was blown up by a bomb.
      Well, there wasn't a bomb this time around but the place looks like it was robbed again. Spraypainted on
      the front of the bank are the words "John McClain was here." You can check out the inside of it by
      entering the front door north of here.
