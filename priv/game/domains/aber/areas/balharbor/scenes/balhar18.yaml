      Welcome! You're standing at the entrance to Bal Harbor, a troubled city plagued by riots and is
      currently under martial law enforce by the Red Sash. There is a large sign next to the gate which
      informs everyone about the current strict curfew hours of the city and another poster alongside offering
      a reward for information leading to the arrest and capture of the individual responsible for
      assasinating the mayor of Bal Harbor. Another note tacked on the gate, a plea from a city resident to
      clean up the criminal infested streets and restore peace to the city.
