    sight: >
      Now this house appears to be in better shape than the others, but still looks to be rundown due to poor
      upkeep by the owners. In fact, the owners don't really care about the shape of the house, since they are
      clueless and dumb. A large couch dominates the living room, some junk litters the floor, some of the
      wallpaper appears torn from the walls, yet the place seems wired for cable! You can exit back to Pines
      south.
