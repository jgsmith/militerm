    sight: >
      You are standing outside of town which lies to the west. A well traveled road can be seen running out
      for miles east of here and you see a subdivision to the northeast which seems to not have escaped
      trouble. You can see dark smoke rising from somewhere in town and hear a lot of shouting and screaming.
