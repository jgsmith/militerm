    sight: >
      A large room with several tables and shelves filled with many vials and jars of chemicals and
      ingredients serves as the alchemist's laboratory. Some large mixing beakers on the center table bubble
      and fizz as the young chemist adds items to the brew creating some wondrous creation. You can go back
      into the showroom to the south.
