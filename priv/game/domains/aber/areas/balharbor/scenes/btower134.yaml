      You have come upon a guarded door, and the individual guarding it doesn't look receptive of you. If
      you're thinking of fleeing the tower now, the way out starts here if you know the way out. The corridors
      don't seem to be any different leading away from here than anyplace else--I guess this was how they kept
      well-armed intruders from making it down here to avoid confrontations.
