    sight: >
      You are inside the city's court house where criminals are tried and convicted of their crimes. This
      building was used by the city officials to make their stand against the rioters until the Sash were
      called in help restore order. Unfortunately, the city officials were locked up in a detention camp run
      by the sash in some unknown location far away from here. This building still stands due to the fact that
      it was built using marble and stone. The bench sits on the north end of the courtroom and a gavel sits
      upon it. There are two tables where the plaintiff and defendant sit, a jury box for twelve jurors, and
      several other seats for the audience. Due to the riots, court is not in session right now, so there's no
      worry of being held for contempt--unless of course some wizard decides to hold a trial in here. A door
      going to the judge's chambers is set next to the judge's bench. You can leave the courthouse through the
      east door.
