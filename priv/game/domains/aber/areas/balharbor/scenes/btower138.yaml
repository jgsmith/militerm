      This appears to be a jail cell for people that Sash has taken prisoner to interrogate or torture. A
      skeleton is chained to the wall on one side of the room. A large chair sits on another side of the room
      next to a table. Escape from this place is difficult, thanks to that maze to get up into the tower and
      the fact that the room have a unsummonable force field to keep people from coming or going.
