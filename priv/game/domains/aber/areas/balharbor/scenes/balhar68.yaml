    sight: >
      Moving further into the subdivision, it appears more than one of those houses fell victim to rioters.
      You see a light-blue house to the west and hear some sort of bashing sound coming from it. You happen to
      notice the front door open and some holes in the wall. Better check it out. You also further survey the
      damage north and south of here.
