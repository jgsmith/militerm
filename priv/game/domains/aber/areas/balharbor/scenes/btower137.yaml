      This highly decorated and furnished living chamber done especially for Sash Commander Sisera seems
      strangely out of place in this spooky tower. Despite that fact, Sisera had this room redone by his men
      so he could be out of sight while he did his planning to take over the country. Looking around, you see
      an expensive scarlet rug, a king-sized bed with silk sheets and velvet blankets covering it, a large
      nightstand with a rare Ming vase, a sizable rack of various wines, and a huge cedar dresser. Some
      strange trinkets are sitting in one corner of the room, which seem to be different from what's generally
      associated with the Sash organization. They look like artifacts of a sorcerer...in fact a small
      engraving on one of those pieces says 'Shazareth'!
