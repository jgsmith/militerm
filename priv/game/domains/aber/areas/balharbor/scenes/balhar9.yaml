      This is what used to be Bal Harbor's pet store, today it is abandoned and run down. Empty cages and pens
      are strung everywhere and pet food has been spilled on the floor in which rodents feed. This shop was
      forced to close down a while back after the riots that plagued the town resulted in the shop being
      looted and the owner murdered. This depressing scene can be left out east.
