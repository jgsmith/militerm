    sight: >
      Dark smoke rises from an empty lot to the north coming from trash cans, carriages, and an abandoned
      building. A few thugs wielding boards, bats, and clubs can be seen smashing vehicles, windows, and
      mailboxes. A building fenced on three sides with barbed and razor wire can be seen to the south,
      obviously to stop people from jumping the fence to trash it. Just in front of that fence is a small
      building that looks like some sort of information trailer. You can get right into the middle of the
      fight to the north, head back into the square west, or travel Main Street to the east into more grim
      scenery.
