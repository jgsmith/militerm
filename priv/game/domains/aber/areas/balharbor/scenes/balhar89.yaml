      It used to look like your typical small newsstand selling newspapers and magazines. These lined a wall
      to the side available for visitors to catch up on escapades happening around the world. Unfortunately,
      some group of angry people deemed everything sold here blasphemy and throughly tore this place apart. It
      seems some people got the bright idea that if they destroy every piece of literature that had a hint of
      politics in it, that all the strife and in-fighting between all the political factions will go away.
      Bits, ashes and scraps of paper litter this room, most of it rendered unreadable. Downstairs is the back
      room of the guild.
