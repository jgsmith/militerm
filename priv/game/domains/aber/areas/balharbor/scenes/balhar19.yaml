    sight: >
      You are standing in the intersection of Cross Road and Main Street. Stepping through the city gates, it
      seems that the city appears to have suffered from a riot recently. And as you look around, you see large
      men wearing red sashes across their uniforms and the residents moving around cautiously. Grim looks can
      be seen on many people's faces, and you wonder by coming to this city if you are even welcome here. City
      streets run each direction, Cross Road runs north through the wizards' shopping center, while to the
      south is the way to the ocean port. Main Street runs east toward Idol Square or you can head back out of
      town to the west.
