    sight: >
      You have come toward a bee hive mounted on post where bee keepers empty honey and jelly the bees produce
      over several months time. However, the bees here do not seem happy with people coming close to their
      hive. I wouldn't stay here for long if you don't like being stung. You can head for the pavilion to the
      west or the pond to the south.
