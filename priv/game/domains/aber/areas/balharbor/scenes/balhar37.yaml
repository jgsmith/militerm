    short: Idol Square
    sight: >
      You are standing northwest of the idol. This part of the square looks as if a more fierce battle has
      taken place, for you're standing next to the city's courthouse. The building's front appears to have
      withstood an onslaught from angry thugs attempting to lynch city officials. Smoldering remains of things
      you don't have a clue what they used to be are scattered everywhere. Another shop where supplies can be
      bought lies to the north. It apparently suffered some damage from attempts to burn it down but the
      owners were well-armed to fend off those rioters.
