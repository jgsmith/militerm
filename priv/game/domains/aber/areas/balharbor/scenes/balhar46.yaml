      The proprietor of this shop appears to have had some success in turning back looters. The shelves look
      like they're filled with various items that are essential for warriors on conquests. Any attempt to loot
      this shop yourself is risky, the owner looks to be very powerful. You can go back into Idol Square to
      the south, or get on River Street to the east.
