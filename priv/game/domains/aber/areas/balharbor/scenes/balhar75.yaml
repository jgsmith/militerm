      Boy, I wouldn't want to see the owners' reaction when they come home to see this! This house looks no
      different than all the others you've seen, but you've had incredible luck catching the vandals in the
      act. A trail of destruction leads to banging noise...sounds like a sledgehammer against a wall. You can
      run out to the south.
