    sight: >
      Going out the side door of the Mage's Guild, you are at the foot of a tall spooky-looking tower which is
      shrouded in dark clouds and thunder and lightening. Looking straight up, you can't even see the top of
      the structure and wonder what could be hiding up there. You sort of wonder who would occupy this tower,
      but looking up toward the entrance you see some spirit guards wielding bastard swords. You may have to
      go up there eventually, but considering how much you're trembling in fear, only as a last resort. Stairs
      leads up to the tower while you can double back to the north.
