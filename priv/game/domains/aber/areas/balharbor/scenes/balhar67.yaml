      Evergreen Pines, the place where citizens moved to get out of the parts of town where crime and violence
      permeate, right? Wrong. Even this part of town didn't escape the riots. Some of the younger thugs that
      trashed the downtown area ran out of things to destroy, so they moved into the outskirts of town to do
      some more damage. There seems to be some attractive-looking houses in this neighborhood, seemingly owned
      by the city's upper-class. A nice white house sits to the west of you...hey! Did you see that? Someone
      just busted out a window with some heavy object! Better investigate it if you're feeling brave, or you
      can ignore it by going north or south.
