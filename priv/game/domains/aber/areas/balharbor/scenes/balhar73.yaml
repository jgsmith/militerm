      Ack...here's another house victimized by young gang members. All the carpet on the floor has been ripped
      up, the furniture broken, and some small dead animals everywhere. The house has been throughly trashed.
      Not much you can do here, this house probably is irreparable now. You can leave east through the broken
      door.
