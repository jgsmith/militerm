    sight: >
      More fires and vandalism can be seen here as you stand in front of the mayor's house where the rioters
      held a final showdown to the former leader of Bal Harbor. The front of the building has been
      spraypainted with various slogans of rebellion and gang violence. All the windows despite the bars
      welded to them have been smashed out. The door to the house is ripped off the hinges lying in a heap of
      twisted metal in the front yard. You also notice scorch marks in various places on the building in which
      an attempt was made to burn it down--fortunately the place was made of stone. You can go in to
      investigate the site south, head north on Vine Street, leave the city out the east gate or go back
      deeper into the city west.
