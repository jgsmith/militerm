      You are moving through the west side of town where several shops serve the spell casters of the
      community. To the west is the town's scribe shop which somehow escaped the rioters' wrath--you happen to
      notice a few very badly burned bodies in the street near the shop where these guys attempted to set this
      building on fire. The roof of the shop appears to have some repairs made to it due to the bottles of lit
      flammable liquid that were thrown on top of it.
