      Here's where it all started. Turmoil over the mayor's ability to lead Bal Harbor began when someone in
      town was a victim of a rather hideous crime--robbery, assault, and rape--all while some officers watched
      (actually, paid to watch since it was apparently staged). So, the public got into a big uproar over the
      thing and demanded the cops resign along with the mayor. The mayor refused to resign and became defiant.
      With stealth Red Sash support and provocation by undercover agents, they were successful in starting a
      riot. The mayor blockaded himself with a few officers to defend him but those men were really undercover
      Red Sash operatives--who were ordered in advance to take him out at just the right time. As you can see
      they were successful. The rest of this place was soon ransacked after the operatives opened the doors
      and let everyone in. The scene now is too awful to describe, so I guess you will have to imagine what's
      in here.
