      Boy, it just doesn't look any better over here! You see another house to the north, where the yard looks
      to be unkept...so does the house! It looks kind of run-down, and you hear music coming from it...along
      with some laughing and snickering. You see another house to the south, you see some ugly-looking sick
      people coming in and out of it. Ugh! Some awful smell is coming from it too! And it smells
      like...contraband! If you wish to get out of here, you can jump the fence to the east where the road
      ends directly into the park. Else go back the way you came.
