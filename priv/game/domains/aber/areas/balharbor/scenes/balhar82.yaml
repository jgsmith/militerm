    short: On the Boat
    sight: >
      You have swam into the hands of the police, national guard, and the beach security force who are
      controlling this boat. Unfortunately even if you were to knock everyone off the boat you would not be
      able to control it, since has no sail or rowing oars and it's anchored. If you want to get out of here,
      it appears you're gonna have to fight these guys or else be executed for trespassing. You can try to
      escape by jumping off in any direction but up.
