      Oh no! Some violent street gang members decided to break into this house as well! This time around the
      scums have ripped the carpet up, busted holes through the walls, torn the banister off the stairs, and
      tossed chunks of wood all over. The furniture can be seen in broken apart in pieces, some of the time
      used to break up the walls. And look at this! Someone is sitting in a corner painting a picture of
      themselves and their handiwork so future generations can see how people their age acted before them!
      This horrible scene can be abandoned by leaving through the hole smashed through the front door to the
      east.
