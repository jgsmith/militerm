    sight: >
      This is the hangout of the hack-and-slash, swashbuckling, smashing, bashing, crashing warriors! Here
      young recruits learn the basics of weaponry, shielding, and fighting skill. Those wishing to test their
      skills against tough opponents can take their chances in the arena to the east. A few wizards have been
      known to battle it out in there, but mortals cannot yet fight each other due to the no playerkilling
      rule. The War Coach who runs this guild had little trouble raising a defense force of all this proteges
      to run off the rioters with their stash of swords, shields and bodyarmor. You can leave the guild to the
      south.
