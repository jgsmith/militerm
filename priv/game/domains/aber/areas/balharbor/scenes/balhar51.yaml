    short: The Alchemist Shop
    sight: >
      Shelves filled with various potions line the walls of this shop. The town's alchemist seems to have done
      well in fighting off the thugs aiming to wreck his shop by lobbing vials of acid mixed up by his
      assistant at them. You can check out the laboratory to the north or get back out on the street to the
      east.
