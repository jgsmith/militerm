      Wow...what destruction! A pile of burnt pieces of lumber and ashes are scattered all over this site
      which resulted from arson. You can't tell what kind of building this used to be, but for sure, whoever
      lived here is now homeless and you can see a small group of homeless people crying in despair. This grim
      scene can be left to the south.
