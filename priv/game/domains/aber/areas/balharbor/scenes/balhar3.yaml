    sight: >
      This is where all the garbage generated by the residents of Bal Harbor is dumped. But what you see here
      is not a landfill, in fact, due to the environmental concerns, a sacrificial pit has been installed
      instead, and in addition to sacrifices to the gods, the trash is dumped here also. Despite this pit, the
      smell of trash still remains strong.
