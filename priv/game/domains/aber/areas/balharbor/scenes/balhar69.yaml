      This little locale has been completely spared from the riots, since it appears to be the home of crime.
      It's certainly where people learn the techniques of pickpocketing, backstabbing, sneaking and whatever
      else. The Master Thief who runs this place trained his thieves well, if you had anything in your hand
      you wouldn't notice if you lost it until it was too late. A trapdoor leads below to some den below.
