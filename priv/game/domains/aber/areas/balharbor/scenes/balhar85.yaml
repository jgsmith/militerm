    sight: >
      You have come up upon a large number of white pillars of salt. What was a supposedly large number of Bal
      Harbor's residents are now all frozen in place. Here these people had gotten over their fear and
      gathered at this locale outside the city. Then the arguing started, and they split up into sides blaming
      each other for what triggered the riots. It got so heated that they started brawling in the middle of
      the road, from the look of the tracks in the dirt. But suddenly it came to a stop. There's a strong
      precense of magic here, it seems someone wanted the fighting and bickering to end...permanently. You can
      work your way through the pillars and enter the center of it to the east if you want to risk an
      encounter with the magic's source, or walk around the pillars north and south.
