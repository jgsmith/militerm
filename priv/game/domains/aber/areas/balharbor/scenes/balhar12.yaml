      This is where is the town's blacksmith makes the weapons and armor he sells. There's an anvil in the
      center of the room, a huge oven in the corner, sheets of steel stacked against the wall on the right,
      and various tools on the workbench. Finished weapons are piled in a box in another corner. How these
      shops remained untouched by the rioters is because of the fact that the blacksmith is very strong and a
      complete expert on the usage of all the weapons and armor he makes. Don't even think of snatching stuff
      when he's around, else he'll tear you apart. You can go back into either shop west and east.
