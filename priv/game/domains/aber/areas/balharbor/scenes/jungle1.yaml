    short: Trail Through the Boulders
    sight: >
      Just managing to squeeze through the boulders, a path heads up a steep rocky hill going eastward. Not
      being a difficult climb, it would be worthwhile to climb up to the cliff overhead. Looking in all other
      directions there's lots of trees. Another path leads south.
