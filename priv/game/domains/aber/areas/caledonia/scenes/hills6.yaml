    sight: >
      You are battling to get through a dense patch of chest-high bracken. Your view of the ground is
      completely obscured by the huge ferns and several times one or other of your feet disappears down a
      rabbit hole, and you are lucky to avoid spraining an ankle. To the north and east the sea of bracken
      continues for a disheartening distance, and you turn your attention to the less impeded routes to the
      south and west.
