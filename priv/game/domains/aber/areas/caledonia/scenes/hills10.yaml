      You are standing atop an upthrust rocky crag upon which you find yourself very much at the mercy of the
      elements. Here there is no protection from the wind, and at such a height the air is far from warm. A
      patch of snow huddles in a hollow on the north side of the crag, but any precipitation falling on the
      other sides of the peak would inevitably be immediately whipped away by the bitter wind.
