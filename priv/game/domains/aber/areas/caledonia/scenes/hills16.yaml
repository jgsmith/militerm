    sight: >
      The bald mountain Suilven casts a great grey shadow over you as you wander about on its lower slopes.
      Above you the trees come to an abrupt end and a rising dome of bare rock dominates the southern skyline.
      The cliffs leading up to the dome become almost vertical further up, so you will have to descend into
      the high valley to the north or east.
