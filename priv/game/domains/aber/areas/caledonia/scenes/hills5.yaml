    short: Heather Slope
    sight: >
      You are on a gentle slope overlooking a murky lochan which fills a hollow in the mountains. To the south
      one of the lesser peaks towers above you, its dark upper slopes looking bluish against the grey sky
      behind. The slope all around you is covered with a thick growth of coarse heather.
