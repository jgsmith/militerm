    short: Pine Forest
    sight: >
      You are walking beneath the tall pine trees that make up this coniferous forest. In the main the
      branches of the trees are well above your head and you can walk about comfortably underneath their
      prickly foliage. A thick layer of pine needles covers the floor of the forest and the ground yields a
      little beneath your weight. To the north-west a granite cliff rises sheer out of the ground and soars
      skyward, imposing and unscalable.
