      You are sitting safely in a fork in the tree trunk. You feel kind of bad for climbing the tree, but you
      see that it was worth the effort, if only because of the view you get of the forest from where you sit.
      You feel like a kind on a throne as you look down into a valley to the northwest. You wonder what could
      be down there. You decide to climb down and have a look.
