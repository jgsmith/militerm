    short: The Grand Oak
    sight: >
      You are now standing at the base of this VERY large oak tree. This tree is absolutely breath-taking! You
      look at the other trees circling around it and wonder how such a freak of nature occurred. You look up
      at the massive branches and discover you can easily climb up the tree.
