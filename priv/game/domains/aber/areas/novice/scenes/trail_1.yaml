    sight: >
      Walking a little bit deeper into the forest you notice how tranquil everything is. You start to feel a
      little strange, however, and you get light butterflies in your stomach as you get the feeling that you
      might be intruding. To the north you notice a small hut, and to the west the forest continues. The
      section of forest to the west seems to be made up almost entirely of very large oak trees.
