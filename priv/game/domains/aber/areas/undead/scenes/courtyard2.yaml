    sight: >
      You stand just inside castle courtyard, the only sound the ghostly remnants of your footsteps as they
      disappear into time. This is a wide open cobbled courtyard. The moss growing from between the cobbles is
      the only living thing you see. The courtyard continues in all directions. There seems little sign of
      life even within the castle walls.
