    sight: >
      You stand in what remains of a once great kitchen. &+BCupboards&* run around all the walls, and large
      stone ovens sit at the end of this huge room. At the very edges of your senses you can hear the hustle
      and bustle of a large kitchen staff running around trying to get food prepared for the banquets that
      were held in the banquet hall. Momentarily the smell of freshly baked &+Bbread&* wafts under your
      nostrils, then suddenly back to reality. You stand in the dark deserted kitchen, and wonder wistfully
      how it came to be in such a state. To your &+Ceast&* and &+Cwest&* lie small arched doorways.
