    sight: >
      This once opulent throne room is just what you expect from a throne room, just a little more run down.
      Suits of armor run along the walls guarding as they have for millenia. Paintings of the royal lineage
      are scattered throughout the room, somewhat dusty, but obviously of remarkable quality. A plush burgundy
      carpet runs the length of the room, and ends at the feet of a huge &+Bthrone&*.
