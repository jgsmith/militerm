      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. Before you stands a vision of &+Rperfection, everything you wish your partner was
      and will be. They are a &+Rperfect physical specimen, everything you could ever want or hope to
      &+Rpossess. They watch you impassively, silent, ever distant. You know one &+Rday they shall be yours.
