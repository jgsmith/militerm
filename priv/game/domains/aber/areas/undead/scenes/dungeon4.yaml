    sight: >
      All around you the heat clings. You stand upon a small island of rock in the centre of a lake of molten
      lava. The shore of the island bubbles and hisses and the lava desperately tries to claim it as its own.
      Large rocks of fiery rock are spat up and deposited on the shore, where they burn with an unearthly
      incandescence. To the &+Cnorth&* the island continues into some form of holding pen, also to the
      &+Ceast&* you can see the island continues.
