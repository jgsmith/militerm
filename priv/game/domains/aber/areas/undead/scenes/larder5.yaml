    sight: >
      You stand in a corner of the larder, it is dank and dark, not the ideal place to keep food. &+BDust&*
      has settled over everything, and from the walls come the sounds of tiny bony feet. To &+Cnorth&* the
      larder continues, to the &+Ceast&* you can also continue into the larder, a set of small stone steps
      lead down into the darkness.
