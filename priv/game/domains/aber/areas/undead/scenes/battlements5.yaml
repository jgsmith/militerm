    sight: >
      You stand upon the ice covered battlements. It is incredibly cold here. Solid ice has formed everywhere.
      You slide around precariously holding onto the castle wall to prevent you sliding off. An ice covered
      wall in front of you bars any further progress. A &+Bbeam&* protrudes from the wall that you grab hold
      of as you slide around. Your skin is freezing as the cold chills you to the bone, and ice starts to form
      on your armor. The battlements continue to the &+Csouth&*, where it looks at least a little warmer.
