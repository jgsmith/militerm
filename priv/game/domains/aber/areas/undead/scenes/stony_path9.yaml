    sight: >
      You are now behind the castle. The moat still looks impassable. Even if it were passable there would be
      nowhere to go, as all that is visible is a large granite wall. The path continues both &+Ceast&* and
      &+Cwest&*. There appears to be a narrow path leading &+Cnorth&* into the mountains.
