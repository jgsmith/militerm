    sight: >
      This holding cell sits on the very edge of the lava. The sound of spitting lava is constant, hot cinders
      scorch your skin constantly and the heat is unbearable. There is no other way off this holding pen than
      to the &+Cnorth&* as thousands of the faceless victims have found out to their own cost.
