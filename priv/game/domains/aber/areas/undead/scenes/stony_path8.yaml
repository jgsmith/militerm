      You stand at the northeastern corner of the moat. To your &+Cnorth&* you see a vast mountain range,
      which even Hannibal would have had second thoughts about crossing (and you have no elephants to help).
      To your &+Ceast&* lies a corn field that looks like it might be ready to harvest. The path continues to
      the &+Cwest&* and &+Csouth&*.
