      You emerge from the hacked path of the forest, into some form of clearing. Scattered around an open fire
      there are several large logs good for sitting on or chopping bits of wood for the fire. You have the
      strange feeling you really don't want to be here. As you consider sitting by the fire you hear voices in
      the wind. To the &+Csouth&* appears to be a shimmering portal, definitely magical. The only other exit
      is back to the &+Ceast&*.
