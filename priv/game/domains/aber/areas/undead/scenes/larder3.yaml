    sight: >
      You stand in a corner of the larder, it is dank and dark, not the ideal place to keep food. &+BDust&*
      has settled over everything, and from the walls come the sounds of tiny bony feet. To the &+Csouth&* the
      larder continues, to the &+Ceast&* you can also continue into the larder.
