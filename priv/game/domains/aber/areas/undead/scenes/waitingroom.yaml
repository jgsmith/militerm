      You pause only momentarily upon entering this room. Something is very very wrong here. You stand it what
      once may have been a large open waiting room some 100 feet across. However now everything seems to have
      both caught fire and be covered in ice! The whole room looks as though it has been torn asunder as the
      tattered remains of its once opulent furnishing lie scattered around. To the &+Csouth&* the banquet hall
      suddenly seems very inviting. To the &+Cnorth&* a large arched door leads to what looks like a throne
      room.
