      You stand at the southwestern corner of the moat. The moat continues &+Cnorth&* as far as the eye can
      see. You can just make out a drawbridge to the &+Ceast. &* The moat still looks impassable and the
      forest is just getting annoying. However, you think you can make out a path through the trees to the
      &+Cwest&*.
