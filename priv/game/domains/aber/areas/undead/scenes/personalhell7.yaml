      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. You sit in a dark and empty &+Rroom. You seem to be waiting for someone you are
      not sure who. All around &+Ryou the sounds of revelry fill your ears. But it is fine, you are
      &+Rstronger than them. Some people are meant to be this way.....aren't they?
