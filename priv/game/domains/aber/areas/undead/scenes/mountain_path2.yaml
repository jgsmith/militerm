      This area of the &+Wmountain&* &+Wpath&* is thankfully a great deal wider than that to the &+Csouth&*.
      The mountains tower above you, casting shadows that make you keep your sword at the ready. You are not
      sure, but it looks as though it may be possible to climb &+Cup&* the side of the mountain if you're not
      carrying too much.
