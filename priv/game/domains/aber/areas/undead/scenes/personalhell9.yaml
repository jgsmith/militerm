      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. You seem to remember a face, a &+Rvague and distant memory of someone, someone you
      knew. Maybe they were a &+Rfriend, you cannot quite remember. The image blurs slightly as your &+Rmemory
      slips. You were friends you remember, whatever did happen to &+Rthem?
