    sight: >
      You arrive at the very centre of the courtyard. The silence here is deafening. Everything is dead. There
      is no sound from above and even the moss in the cobble stones has withered and died. There stands a once
      grand fountain in the very centre of the courtyard, from which water must once have flown. Now centuries
      of neglect have reduced it to little more than a pile of rubble.
