    sight: >
      You stand at the northwestern corner of the courtyard. Above you the battlements continue to the
      &+Csouth&*, as the cobblestones continue in the same direction. The silence is total, even the sound of
      your own footsteps ring hollow as though they have had the life bled out of them. The courtyard
      continues to both the &+Csouth&* and the &+Ceast&*.
