      As you step into the room you are rushed into void of what seems to be BILLIONS of stars shooting
      straight at you but realize they are not striking you, just flying by. You shake your head realizing
      you've stepped into a magical portal and are floating above what seems to be nothing. This looks like a
      safe place to rest before your brave adventure continues, for you do not know what might be on the other
      side of this strange magical portal. The only exit you see is &+Cdown&*.
