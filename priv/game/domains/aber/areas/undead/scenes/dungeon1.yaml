    sight: >
      You stand at the entrance to the Undead King dungeon. Unlike the rest of the castle there is a
      remarkable lack of damp, it is not cold and it is well lit and remarkably clean. Several lanterns built
      into the wall light your way. This stark contrast to what you expected is somewhat perplexing. The walls
      appear to be made of a smooth hard rock, slightly cold to the touch. To the &+Cwest&* is an opened wall
      that seems to lead to the throne room. To your &+Ceast&* the dungeon continues.
