      You stand at the bottom of a set of stone steps. The darkness embraces you, as your light flickers
      weakly against the walls. This appears to have once been a wine cellar, there is little here now. Maybe
      the long gone kitchen staff came here for their severance pay. Row upon row of empty wine racks stretch
      for as far as the eye can see.
