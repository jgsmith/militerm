      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. You watch yourself trying to &+Rwork out what you are doing. You seem to be
      examining yourself carefully &+Rin a mirror, it seems there is a blemish that has somehow upset you. If
      &+Ronly it were different, things would all be better if it was not for that &+Rblemish. If only.
