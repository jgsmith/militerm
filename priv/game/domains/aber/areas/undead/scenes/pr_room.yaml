    short: Dark Reading Room
    sight: >
      Within this room the unearthly silence is total, the darkness is engulfing and welcomes you, holding you
      like a long lost friend. The cold instantly starts to chill you to the bone. Your light struggles to
      light the grim granite walls and hard stone floor. In the centre of the room appears a small
      unremarkable wooden &+Bstool&*. It would appear as uncomfortable and cold this room is it may actually
      be a private reading room, it would appear the Undead King has little use for home comforts.
