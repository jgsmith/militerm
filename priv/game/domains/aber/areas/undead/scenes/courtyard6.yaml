    sight: >
      You stand at the eastern side of the courtyard. Above you the battlements runs &+Cnorth&* and
      &+Csouth&*, as the cobblestones continue in the same direction. The silence is becoming deafening. Even
      the moss between the cobblestones seems to be turning black and giving up its struggle for life. A
      strange sense of foreboding over comes you as you wonder if this is really worth it.
