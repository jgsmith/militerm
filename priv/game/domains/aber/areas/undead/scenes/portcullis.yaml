      Well it looks as though your journey may be coming to an end. Within these walls is the &+RUndead
      King&*. Not as tough as he made out really. Before you stands a large open portcullis, and to your
      &+Csouth&* is the open drawbridge. You look around nervously wondering why anyone would have a
      portcullis and leave it open? Oh well enough of contemplation... time to move on.
