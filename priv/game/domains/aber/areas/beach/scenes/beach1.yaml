    sight: >
      This is a patch of beach that extends to the north and south. The waves from the sea to the east come
      rolling gently in, making you feel calm, and careless. Maybe you could take you shoes off and walk
      barefoot in the sand. Or even better, wiggle your toes in the soft, warm sand.
