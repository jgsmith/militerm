    sight: >
      Here you have reached a harbour, the air is sweet, and filled with the laughter of children. The dock
      here is small but elegant, and the dock hand easily guides the Savannah Jane to her dock. Looking inland
      you see a small town, filled with peace. The children here play on the shore here, and all is safe. You
      may never want to leave.
