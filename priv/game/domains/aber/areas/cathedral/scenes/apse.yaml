    sight: >
      You finally reach the apse of this once mighty church. Here above the choir, and at the end of the long
      nave, you see the altar where patrons used to pray. It stands before you in shameful condition. Huge
      chunks of shaped marble litter the floor, remnants of a grand sculptured altarpiece, now in ruin. Behind
      the altar lies a monstrous wallpainting. Seering &+Rred &+Beyes&* gaze down upon you hatefully, and wide
      grinning mouths show pointed teeth and drip &+rblood&*, under a &+Rreddish&*-&+Mpurple &+Csky&*.
