      In the center of this room is a large &+Liron &+blantern&*, mounted solidly on the floor. The windows
      which used to bring &+Ylight&* in by day, and allow the lantern to shine out by &+Lnight&*, have been
      &+yboarded&* over. &+LCobwebs&* are strewn over everything, and a &+gmusty&* smell fills your nostrils.
