      You nearly lose your lunch as you enter this place. Stinking &+yrotting&* flesh lines the floor,
      ceiling, and walls. bodies in various stages of &+Ldecay&* line the place. The floor is covered in a
      thick layer of &+Rreddish &+rooze&*, which must be the same stuff which is dripping slowly onto you from
