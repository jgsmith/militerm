    sight: >
      You stand at the beginning of the long nave of the cathedral, which stretches out a great distance to
      the east. The triforiums run along the northern and southern sides, with great columns of polished
      &+Wwhite&* marble soaring upward into &+Ldarkness&* to support the vaulted ceiling, which is onlybarely
      visible. The clerestory windows are blocked off by the &+Lstorm&* ragingoutside, and no light passes
      through. To your north, through a high arch, lies the northern tower. Likewise, to the south, there is
      another tower. To the west the royal portals appear to be boarded up, but the nave continues to the
      east.
