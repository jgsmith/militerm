    sight: >
      The floor here is smoothly tiled, as is the high ceiling. Racks line the walls, and upon the racks sit
      weapons of all types from all places and times. Whomever built this place seems to have a fascination
      for collecting fine things, or perhaps he just gets bored living for all eternity, and collecting gives
      him a purpose. A piercing stench rises from the south.
