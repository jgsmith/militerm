      You are in the master bedroom of this house. A large, luxurious bed takes up the northern wall along
      with the nightstands that are to the left and right of it. There is a large fireplace set into the
      southern wall with several pictures placed on top of the mantle. There is also a small fish tank on top
      of the mantle and a beautiful Beta fish swims around showing off his glourious floating fins. To the
      east is a baby room or you can leave to the west.
