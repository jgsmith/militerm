      You were told this way lead you to the children's closet. Children are running around bumping into you
      and everyone else. Upon the walls are more pictures of kids who have been here before. There is writing
      on the wall in crayon. You are sure whoever did this has been punished appropriately. Your journey into
      what you are sure must resemble a madhouse on the bad days continues north into a closet. It also leads
      west into the house.
