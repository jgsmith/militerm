      This is where the teeter-totters reside in the playyard. The teeter- totters are painted a bright
      &+Ylemon-yellow&*. They remind you of all the fun you used to have on these contraptions when you were
      just a wee one. The chainlink fence blocks your passage to the north and east. To the south you can go
      play in the sandbox. Of course you could always decide to go to the west and play on the swings.
