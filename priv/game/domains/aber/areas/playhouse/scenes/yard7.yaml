    short: Kiddy Picnic Table
    sight: >
      It looks to be a mini-picnic table. You get a picture of the seven dwarfs gone to dinner in your head.
      (If you can actually picture this you're certifiable!) The table looks perfect for the children to sit
      at and have a tea party or something at. The yard continues to the west into the playpen area. To the
      north is the middle of the yard. To the east is where the kids ride on the kiddy bikes, tricycles and
      things.
