      This is Grandie and Sweetie's room as the title says. There are model planes hanging from the ceiling
      and a few dollies laying around. There is a Sega system sitting in a place of honor on a shelf. I wonder
      who likes that so much that it gets such a special place for just it and it's cartridges? There is a
      computer running over in the corner on a desk put there just for it. The keys are rather worn -- someone
      must use it alot. There are two exits leading from this room, one leading west to the landing and one
      leading south to the washroom. The curtains hanging from the rooms only window flaps in the breeze.
