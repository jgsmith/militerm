    sight: >
      This room looks to be designed souly to hold the various costumes the children use on the holiday
      Halloween. Hanging in rows after rows are various costumes of all sorts. From the all important &+RDevil
      &*outfit, to the &+Wwedding gown&*. All made in childrens sizes, some cute, some ugly, some small, some
      fat. It makes you wish that you were a child again just so that you could put one on. The pathway leads
      to the east and south from here.
