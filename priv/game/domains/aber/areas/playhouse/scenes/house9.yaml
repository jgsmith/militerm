    short: Quiet Room
    sight: >
      This is the room the children are sent to for punishment. There are little chairs positioned all
      throughout the room. You figure a child must be sent here and made to sit here till quiet time is up.
      How could someone possibly make a child sitdown for that long of a time you ponder. Up on the wall is a
      very long piece of wood that resembles a pingpong paddle only bigger. Wrote on the board it says
      &=lw'Board of Education' &*in bold black letters. Now you know how the children are kept sitting down.
      The exits lead north and west
