    sight: >
      You continue south through these breathtaking hills, the sun is setting to the west creating a beautiful
      backdrop that clashes with the spindery, and demented mountains to the south. To the west is a forest of
      redwoods thrusting up into the heavens. To the east the land leves out into a pasture, and beyond that,
      a swamp.
