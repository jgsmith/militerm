      As you emerge into what looks to be the bottom of a huge pit, the sunlight glaring down from above
      temporarily blinds you. After your eyes adjust to the sudden burst of light, you are able to take in
      your surroundings. Your first impression was right, this is a huge deep, cavernous pit, carved out of
      the top of the mesa, by some evil dark magic. Looking around you notice magical runes of all kinds, you
      can recognize only a few, those of protection and warding. Skeletons hang from the walls, some from
      creatures you recognize, and others you could only guess as to their origin. Black streaks line the
      walls too, possibly from long battles with demons only a crazed evil mage would summon onto this
      plane... A sudden sense of fear comes over you.. You have never met anyone powerful enough to create a
      place such as this, and don't want to stay long enough to meet the person who DID create this ghastly
      place.
