    sight: >
      Thankfully trudging out of the marsh you have reached a huge grove, huge trees and scrub bushes form a
      perfect circle about 15 feet away from a huge cauldron in the center of the grove. The smell of nature
      is stong in the air, but there is also a strong pugnent odor of unnatural origin hanging in the air.
