    sight: >
      You have fallen into a hexoganal room made of mirrors. In one corner stands an iron tree with one
      branch, from which hangs a noose. In the bright light, the tree is reflected into a huge forest. As the
      room is slowly heated up, you begin to hallucinate that you are in an African forest. The room continues
      to get hotter until you either are roasted alive, or, unable to take the torture any longer, hang
      yourself on the iron tree.
