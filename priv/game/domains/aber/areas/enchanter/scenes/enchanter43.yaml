    sight: >
      The gates here seem shiny and new, in stark contrast to the rest of the castle. They're wide open, and
      through them you can see a wide green meadow, and beyond it, the sea. There's a tower to the east, and
      the hall continues to the west or the north. You can hear the sound of heavy machinery to the east.
