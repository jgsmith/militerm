    sight: >
      You momentarily forget about the horror of the castle as you look around in awe. The meadow is green,
      birds are singing, rabbits are hopping through the grass, and all is peaceful. You feel like taking off
      your shoes and running around barefoot, but you'd probably stub your toe on a hidden rock. There's a
      path leading southwest, and the castle rises to the north.
