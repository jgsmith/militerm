    sight: >
      The floor and cieling are scorching hot, and the walls jet flame occaisionally that you have to jump
      over. The walls waver and shimmer in the heat, and you cannot survive much longer. To the north the hall
      becomes smooth stone, and to the south fire and ice meet in a flowing, moving artwork.
