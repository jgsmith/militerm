    short: Thick Forest
    sight: >
      The thick forest surrounds you, overwhelming your senses. The forest streches to the north, south, and
      east. The forest to the west is thick and overgrown with brambles as far as you can see. There appears
      to be trails, but after following them for a short time they fade away, leaving you more lost then when
      you began.
