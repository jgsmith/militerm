    sight: >
      You stand within a tiny hut that appears to be woven of living branches and vines, probably by an elf
      for temporary shelter. The roof of the hut stands open to the weather, the magic that allowed air to
      pass through but not rain having since worn off. The only exit from the hut is back to the north.
