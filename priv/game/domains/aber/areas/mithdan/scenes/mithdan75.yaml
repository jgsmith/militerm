      Large rocks have been placed in the center of a large strech of pure white sand, which has been
      carefully raked into curving lines that swirl around the stones like eddies in water. A wooden bench has
      been provided to sit upon and contemplate the garden. The soft burble of the fountain to the west adds a
      pleasant undertone.
