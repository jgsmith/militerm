    short: Thin Trail
    sight: >
      The trail is thin and unkempt, the forest struggling to reclaim it. To the east and west the trail thins
      out into forest, but to the north and south the trail continues. The east trail is hreavily overgrown
      with brambles and thorns. You can only see the sky in patches, the forest canopy has grown thick over
      the trail.
