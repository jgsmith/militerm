    sight: >
      Huge crystaline trees overhang the trail and delicate crystal flowers grow on the edge. You are afraid
      to touch any of them for fear that they will shatter. Heavy wind blows through the tops of the trees,
      and to the east there is an ominous groaning and cracking noise.
