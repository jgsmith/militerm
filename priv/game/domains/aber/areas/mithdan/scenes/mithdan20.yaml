    short: Winding Ledge
    sight: >
      The ledge is covered with snow, and with each step you risk plunging into the deep gorge below you. The
      stone at your back is rough and cold, and the ledge is only a few paces wide. To the west a huge flat
      stone slants down towards a path, and the ledge continues to the east.
