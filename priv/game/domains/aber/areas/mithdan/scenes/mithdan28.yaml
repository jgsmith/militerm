    short: Stone Clearing
    sight: >
      The clearing looks as if it was formed hundreds of years ago by a searing heat. The ground beneath you
      is perfectly smooth stone, and its almost polished surface reflects the suns rays into your face. The
      clearing becomes a thin trail leading down the side of the mountain to the west, and to the south the
      trail passes beneath a huge stone arch.
