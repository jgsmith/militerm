    short: Green Forest
    sight: >
      Healthy green forest streches as far as the eye can see. Far to the north you hear a faint musical song.
      The forest to the west is filled with brambles and there is no way to get through. A thin trail that
      must have been made by animals leads to the south, and the forest continues unabated to the north.
