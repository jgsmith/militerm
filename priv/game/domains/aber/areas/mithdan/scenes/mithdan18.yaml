    short: Mountain Trail
    sight: >
      The trail here slopes upwards, leading towards the top of the mountain, although the end of the trail is
      obscured by the drifting snow. Forest covers the horizon to the north, the green leaves a sharp contrast
      to the snowy peaks above you. The trail continues flat towards the forest, or you can follow it up the
      side of the mountain.
