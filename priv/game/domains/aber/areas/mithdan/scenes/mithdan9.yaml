    short: Thick Forest
    sight: >
      The forest turns you around, leading you along on false trails. You wish you had a compass but with
      these woods it might not do much good. The forest leads to the north, south, and west. As is much of the
      forest, the eastern way is blocked by thick and heavy forests.
