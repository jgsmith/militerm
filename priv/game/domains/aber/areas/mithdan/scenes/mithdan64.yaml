      The grass here is trimmed short, and to the north the deep forest streches towards the horizon. To the
      south is an immense wooden gate that stand open, showing what appears to be a perfectly normal rocky
      path. The gate itself crackles with heavy stored magical energy that occaisionally discharges into the
      sky in huge reverse lightning bolts.
