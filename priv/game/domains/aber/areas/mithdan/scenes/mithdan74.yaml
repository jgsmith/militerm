    sight: >
      The fountain draws water from an immense pool in which several large fish swim. The fountain itself is
      covered with runes and is made of the finest polished marble. The water jets over twenty paces into the
      sky before cascading down several marble terraces back to the fountain pool. A path winds through the
      garden to the north, and to the east is a quiet rock garden.
