    short: Sacred Clearing
    sight: >
      This clearing throbs with magic, the very trees almost glow with the force of it. A heavy wind whips
      through the trees as you enter, as if the force that guards this clearing is displeased with your
      presence. It would probably be a good idea to leave and not anger it further.
