    sight: >
      Amazingly, in this room fire and ice flow together, covering the walls and creating a living, moving
      sculpture in the center of the chamber. You gaze at it breifly, but when you look away it is several
      hours later. Time means nothing in this room. To the north there is a smooth stone hallway, and to the
      south there is a terrific wind, and you see what appears to be a contained tornado.
