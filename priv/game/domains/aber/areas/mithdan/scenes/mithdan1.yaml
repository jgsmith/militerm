    short: Thin Trail
    sight: >
      Origionally created by animals, this trail has been widened by human passage, although it looks as if it
      has not been traveled lately. The forest has grown close to the edge of the trail, and thick branches
      reach overhead that catch the snow. The thin trail continues to the east and to the south, the snow much
      thinner there, and to the west there is an icy trail.
