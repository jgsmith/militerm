      Lots of bottles and flasks lie about this room, but it all looks like worthless clutter. It appears
      whatever alchemist has been working here is really very adept at his art. There are a lot of formulae
      and spells written on the walls too... couldn't he buy some paper? There is a door to the north, and
      also a dark &+Gstairway&* in the corner leading down, with a large &+Gsign&* next to it that you
      probably should read...
