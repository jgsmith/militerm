      As you walk in, the first thing you notice is the opposite wall. It is lined, floor to ceiling with
      guitars. You notice various vintage models: the double-necked Gibson that Jimmy Page played "Stairway to
      Heaven" on live, the double-necked Rickenbacker bass/guitar that Geddy Lee used with RUSH, the Fender
      Stratocaster that David Gilmour recorded "Dark Side of the Moon" on, the Stratocaster that Eric Clapton
      played on "Layla," and the Ibanez played by Steve Vai. In the corner, you notice a little upright piano
      -- an inscription tells you that Tori Amos learned to play on this very instrument. Looking to the wall
      on your right, you see an impressive stereo system with an equally impressive CD collection: autographed
      copies of "The Wall", "Slowhand", "Houses of the Holy", "Moving Pictures", "Under the Pink", and
      "Sailing the Seas of Cheese" (you stop and think to yourself: "Sailing the Seas of Cheese"?!) On the
      wall above the CD player, there is a limited edition 10,000 Maniacs/ REM poster in a black frame,
      autographed by various members of the bands. You also notice a note on the Under the Pink CD which says
      "Stay awake next time!" In the center of the room is a large whirlpool. Oddly enough, it appears to be
      in the shape of a large cucumber, and the lights under the water give it a strange purple glow. Too bad
      you didn't bring your speedos. The room is well furnished in all black, with black marble floors and
      what looks like obsidian trim. You are tempted to have a seat on the plush black sofa, pop in a CD, and
      listen to your favorite tunes.
