    sight: >
      Noises emanate from the bazaar to the west, completely opposite of the peaceful silence that is to the
      east. The road here has been cobblestoned and fashioned into a plaza where the three roads of Kyerstarn
      intersect. There is an aerial shield of filtered sky-colored energy surrounding a well-tended circle of
      temperate bluegrass. Shooting a perpetual column of water is a natural geyser, yet imbued with sanctual
      properties at the nearness of the divine park. It is said that those with the power to travel through a
      volcano may drink from this geyser to restore any flower garden destroyed by the ghouls and lizards of
      Fallenthorp. The residential districts of Kyerstarn lie along the northern path.
