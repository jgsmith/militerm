      The denizens of the city revere the guardians of the evil winds, and this street was named after the one
      entrusted with the west-blowing breeze of evil. The road rock is made into a cobblestoned pattern,
      making walking a chore. Lining the sides are ditches in which flow small streams of magma. At some
      points along these gutters are rocky bridges allowing the ghouls easy access to and from their
      residences. Shouting comes from the west, and the plaza is to the east.
