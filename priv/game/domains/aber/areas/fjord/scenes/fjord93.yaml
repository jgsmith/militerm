    short: Kyerstarn Village Square
    sight: >
      The infamous market square of this remote village has thousands of buisness transactions done each day.
      The entire open are is packed with bazaar merchants from as far as away as the deserts near the southern
      end of the continent to trade for the largest sizes in some exotic species of fish, fresh from the north
      inlets. Selling at high prices while using the resources of the inlet efficiently, the people of
      Kyerstarn will take gold in exchange form their catches, but prefer cold winter survivial gear and the
      wonder of knowledge. They will even sell for a good story, since they lack many books commonplace to
      most of the world. What they do have is kept safe in the library to the south, while the town meeting
      hall is to the north.
