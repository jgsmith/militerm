    sight: >
      Dusty bits of mold and paper blow through this derelict building. No one in Kyerstarn has bothered to
      fix this now tilting conglomeration of high-pressed clay because of its indeterminable value. It might
      prove to be a complete lemon of an investment. A damp staircase of mildew leads to an underground
      cellar.
