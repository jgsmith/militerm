    sight: >
      Nothing lives down this way other than the white and green striped patches of volcanic mushrooms and
      mold. Covering nearly every square inch of volcanic rock floor is a entanglement of thick white vines
      which form the nutrient transport system for the mushroom jungle. A lizard, still clad in full
      battle-gear, has had its throat completely crushed and partially ripped by the strain of three white
      vines simultaneously pulling. The barbed hooks on the vines still eagerly drink from the dead reptilian
      husk. Meanwhile, a mushroom off to the side has managed to ensnare the head of a ghoul and rip off the
      top half of its skull to dine on what passes for brain material. This is one area of the city which even
      most of the population won't venture into.
