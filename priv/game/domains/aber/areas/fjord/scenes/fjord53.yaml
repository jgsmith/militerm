    short: Within the Caldera
    sight: >
      The basin housing the volcano to the north stretches away in all directions. It is filled with quite a
      lot of snow, some places reaching as much as twenty feet deep. Fortunately, most of the pack is somewhat
      solid and enchanced in strength by the surface layers of ice. Wandering aimlessly through the caldera
      are many shades of the underworld, stark against the snow and looking for bodies to drain life-force
      from. Cold temperatures and the thin air here have prevented many of the corpses from decomposing and
      some faces are forever frozen in ice, shock, and pain. At least they didn't suffer long as their spirits
      were sent to join the army of roamers here.
