    sight: >
      A wide semi-circular sweep of stone benches tier down to an alcove of solid black lava rock. His fists
      waving furiously and yelling in a dark tongue, the lecturing zombie meister curses the eastern side
      ghouls for their foul trickery and swears to have undying vengeance. In response to the rotting corpse,
      cackling howls echo from the rows of seated, hooded, reptilian horrors. One lifts its head above the
      rest, and a massive fireball sent up by the power of the crowd illuminates thousands of fluidic teeth
      which grind ceaselessly against each other and claws made of shifting sulfur vapor, forming and
      reforming hideous versions of claws. Small volcanic alleys lead north and south, and a large street
      leads east.
