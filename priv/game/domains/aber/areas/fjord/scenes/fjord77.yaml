      A dark alley leads between the shouting and chanting crowd to the north and this rather large, concealed
      chamber. The entire floor is covered in dried ichor, dripped from the heads of both lizards and ghouls
      which are mounted on pikes stuck in the floor. Spears coated in acidic poison impale more bodies to
      walls, and a rack of lava rock keeps freshly forged halberds and morning stars readily available to
      whatever factions choose to raid here. Painted in the multi-colored blood of countless souls in
      straight-line lettering is the message 'Few be the chosen, but none there be still among us.' With no
      guards in attendance, the city dwellers can come by at their leisure and take their weapons of choice at
      will.
