    sight: >
      There exists heavy indicators of an inverse relationship between the altitiude and the number of trees.
      Parts of the mountain side are bare, covered in nothing but chipped slate and pieces of loose earth.
      Each step over these areas causes minor avalanches of gravel, and the effort of treading such ground
      causes continual disruption of the ability to keep alert. The fastest way to traverse this slope is via
      a shallow gully filled with half-buried roots and gnarled, dried-up pine tree roots. About a hundred
      feet below is where many miles of trees have been cleared by huge hands, while the gully breaks in two
      up above, leading west and north.
