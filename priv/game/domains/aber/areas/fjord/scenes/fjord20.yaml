      The slope of the bottom of the lake is much less sharp in this region. Average depth of the water is
      perhaps ten to fifteen feet, and the bottom is entirely sandy. Leading from the lake bank by the shore
      are two thick fishing nets, tied securely to the shore and at every point along the lake bottom. They
      are set far enough apart to admit a single craft, similar to a private docking slot at a harbor. The
      waves of the leave gently push towards the shoreline.
