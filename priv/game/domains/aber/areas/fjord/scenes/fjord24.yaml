    sight: >
      The lakeside continues to be sandy around the south bank. Here the sand takes on a darker glow with
      flecks of black in it. Clumps of soggy, decaying &+yweeds&* and broken pieces of &+ybark&* wash up
      occasionally and deposit themselves ever deeper into the sand. The dirt white line left by the lake's
      foamy wave tips is prominent as it meanders across the beach. The ebb and flow of the tide moves this
      line up and down at various times of the day. A large tree trunk blocks the beach to the west, but the
      eastern way is clear.
