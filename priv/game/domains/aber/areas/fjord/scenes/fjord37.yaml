    short: Slope of Dead Pines
    sight: >
      There is a surprising number of dead pines along this route. The path of the one who ripped asunder
      weeds to the south has visited this section also, as claw marks are borne by the shredded bark on the
      long-deceased trunks. To your right, a tree has even been felled by one monstrous sweep and thrown a
      good twenty feet. The ground slopes upward to the north and down to the regular forest level to the
      south.
