    sight: >
      No signs have been erected to say 'deer crossing' happens here, but there is sufficient evidence to let
      travelers know what kind of population occupies this territory. Deer &+ydroppings&* resembling small
      blueberries cannot avoid being stepped in except by their droppers, as suggested by sets of hoof prints
      cleverly negotiating the maze of excrement. Over time, the droppings feed nutrients into the soil, which
      are then taken up by the brown and orange &+ylichen&* growing up the sides of trees and boulders. One
      some rocks where there are large depressions from erosion, the lichen fill the space in completely to
      form a spongy throne, perfect for resting in.
