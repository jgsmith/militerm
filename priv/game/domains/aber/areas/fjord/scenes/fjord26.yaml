      The murky, sandy ditch continues right to a wall of root-entangled earth. The grasses of the meadow
      surrounding the lake fight for room at this once-upon-a-time lake outlet, all wanting the most water
      they can scrounge up. This section of the ditch dips about a foot lower than the rest of it to the
      north, and the larger amount of water makes for a nice foot spa. Worms poke their heads or tails out of
      the sodden bank, where they have eaten a path and are quickly reminded by the open air not to go any
      farther.
