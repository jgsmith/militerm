      The pit dimensions have been measured to perfection, perhaps to ensure that the rituals carried out here
      go smoothly. The wooden walls and marble slab in the center were long since placed under magical
      protection from the effects of erosion. The slab is decorated with many types of quartz and treated with
      a super-hard coating of a potent magic solution in an effort to keep legible the inlaid signatures of
      those who had previously performed evocations to other planes of existence here. Covering the sides of
      the slab to the ground are strings of carefully pruned ivy as fresh and green as if they were
      sproutlings. The only exit is out of the pit.
