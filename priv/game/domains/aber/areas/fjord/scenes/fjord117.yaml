    sight: >
      The northern bounday of the village is marked by an abrupt circle of flattened dirt ringed by evenly
      spaced glass spheres. Each sphere throws off three rays of dark blue light at night which illuminate
      this section of town. To the east and west are more houses, which are surrounded by faintly glowing
      green rods of energy. These rods act as a magical security field implemented for the residents of
      Kyerstarn who live on this frontier edge of town. Far to the north and northeast are places of dark
      barbarians; electrically charged cousins of the lizards of Fallenthorp. Unlike those inside the volcano,
      though, these lizards are alive and thus allowed to inhabit this world.
