    sight: >
      Stone bookcases with wooden supports have been constructed to hold the books which, in time, will
      inhabit them. A lone clerk sits behind a desk doing her daily work of stamping out orders for books and
      clearing out receipts of sale to the library. It is also her job, and the job of everyone, to be totally
      literate and help contribute to the town's poor supply of stories. Since paper can be readily made from
      the Muskrat pines to the south, the villagers use their divinely strengthened powers of spirit and
      community to, quite literally, move mountains and get at the trees.
