      During the times that the city dwellers are not fighting or feasting on the bones of the slain, they
      gather here in homogenous factories to labor on the ore needed for the nearly constant demand of fresh
      weapons for the new spawn produced to the west. Smokestacks reaching higher than the tallest skyscraper
      let loose the billowing clouds of hazardous by-products of the manufacturing processes. The clang of
      metal on metal beats at an even rhythm as hundreds of shields, swords, and suits of scale mail are
      eagerly produced, fed by the ghouls' and lizards' mutual undying need for vengeance and pain.
