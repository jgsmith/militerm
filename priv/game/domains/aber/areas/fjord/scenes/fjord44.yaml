      The trail stays snug against the mountain, where intermittent patches of snow drop onto the level ground
      and melt. The ground grows much more muddy to the east, where the trail ends at a glacier. Here the
      switchbacks occur in greater number as the near vertical faces of the mountain swing into view, still
      partially obscured by the clouds. The howl of a gusty wind greets you everywhere at this level.
