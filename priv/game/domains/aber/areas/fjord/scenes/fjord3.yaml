    sight: >
      The gravel trail leads straight to the hut's main entrance and back west to the T-intersection. Some
      small gardening &+Ctools&* and pieces of broken flower &+Gpots&* are scattered here. One crossbar window
      by the front entrance is shattered in one of its four panes, letting the wind whistle through it. Soft
      pine needles, brown and lifeless, sweep around the area and through the open doorway.
