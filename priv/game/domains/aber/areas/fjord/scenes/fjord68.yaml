      This cul-de-sac dips down nearly a hundred feet to a flat square about three feet across at the bottom.
      Around the edges, cackling ghouls with serrated ears and blue insignias dump freshly melted rock down
      the sides and howl with laughter as an orange lizard of an opposing faction scrambling frantically and
      futilely is set on fire by the advancing lava. An iron cage stands nearby, filled with more lizards to
      be fed to the &+Rpit of lava&*. After the mass executions are done, the ghouls break up in search of
      more fodder for their fire.
