      The air is fresh in here despite its locale to the outside world. Racks of candles line all the stony
      walls at regular spacing, but their wicks are now composed of ash and the candle wax of very poor
      quality. in the center of the room is a deep square dug into the ground, its walls reinforced with pine
      two-by-fours and tar pitch. A smooth block of marble has been weathered and placed in the exact center
      of the pit. Attached to each wall is an animal &+cskull&*, the bones glinting in your light.
