    short: Lake Punjowltah
    sight: >
      The smoothness of the lake is not broken easily. Most boats produce very little wake in the crystal
      blueness, A school of small cutter fish ride the gentle waves to and from their feeding areas and homes.
      Occasionally, a larger fish will break cover and speed by, providing a glimpse of fins and tail. A light
      wind blows across the lake, cool and refreshing, but barely manages to ruffle the lake surface. Set out
      from the pier is a bobbing &+Ybuoy&* in the shape of a duck, an animal now extinct in this area. It was
      once used to help capture exquisite ducks, but now just floats endlessly about the lake.
