    short: Rim of the Crater
    sight: >
      Smoke, sulfur fumes, and puffs of ash are choked up by the crater and provide a nice display of
      pyrotechnics. The lip of the crater is a high and pointy ridge which slopes heavily down on all sides,
      but provides an excellent view of the surrounding caldera and mountains. Past the northern reaches of
      the Nolaks, the lands slopes sharply back down via ice and snowdrifts to the cold north sea. The lip
      provides easy walking access to the south, while a stone-carved staircase drops back down the mountain.
