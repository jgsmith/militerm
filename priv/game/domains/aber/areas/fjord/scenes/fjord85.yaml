    sight: >
      Snow-capped peaks with enormous avalanche and geological potential tower all around, pointing their tips
      towards the heavens in total defiance of Mother Nature's attempts to erode them. Just visible from this
      distance on Mt. Doralade is a nest made of the grass found only in the meadows far to the south. It is
      currently uninhabited, however. The sounds of the ocean can be heard faintly as the waves crash against
      the base of these mountainous slopes.
