    short: Muskrat Pine Forest
    sight: >
      All around are densely packed pine trees. Millions of cones hand from the trees and litter the decaying
      undergrowth. A musty scent is present in the dimly lit atmosphere along with the sweetness of sticky
      pine sap. Occasionally, a deer will hop along at the edge of peripheral vision, its only goals in life
      to feed its young and avoid being turned into roasted venison. A gravel trail leads south to thinning
      forest and loses clarity to the east.
