    short: Pit of Bugs
    sight: >
      Oh dear, you've just wandered into a lair of creepy, crawling horrors! Born of millions of shapes,
      sizes, and colors, the little six-legged and winged critters crawl up your legs and buzz about your
      ears. The bottom of the pit is made of total decayed mush and dead insects. If any water were to ever
      get down here, then there would be a thriving colony of bacteria inside the quicksand-like mass of bugs.
      The hole back to the land of the living is a couple feet overhead, and very little sunlight makes it
      through the clutter of undergrowth and around the sharp angle of the pit sides. The violent movement of
      all the bugs causes the 'floor' to move like waves on the ocean. Something very slimy and long slithers
      at the nape of your neck.
