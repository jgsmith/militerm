    sight: >
      Dangerous water completely surrounds you right outside the inlet. No boat strong enough to withstand the
      pounding force of the open waves or the undertow generated by each cresting swell exists yet. The only
      safety lies back to the south between the sinking fingers of the Nolak Mountains, but truly courageous
      adventurers may seek and never find their peril, maiming, and doom to yonder waves. Out there, the
      elements have full control of everything, and they are in no mood to brake for anyone or anything. Yet
      that environment remains ideal for larger creatures of the sea.
