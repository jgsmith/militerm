      The plush residence that is the property of the House of Snordsyk keeps well-tended in all seasons of
      the year, even through the fact that all the seasons up this far north are cold. Servants of the manor
      abound perform their daily duties without fail, for sometimes seldom are the available jobs in the
      village. Siding the steps of the manor are two massive statues of wyverns, each depicting the royal
      crest of the family. A flaming sword loaded on a strung crossbow suggests the fighting ferocity that
      this house has produced over the centuries to combat the forces of Fallenthorp.
