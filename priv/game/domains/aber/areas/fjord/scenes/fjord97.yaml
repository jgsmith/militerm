      It's carp time! But then again, that is only one of the many types of fish thrown on tables or hanging
      by their tails on a rack. This is where the captured prizes of the inlet are cleaned, gutted, and made
      ready to be cooked by the customer or traded away for the benefit of the entire village. Tags marking
      species, weight, scarcity, and price are slapped to each fish to allow all to see the variety of
      selection. On the processing tables strewn in rows about the room are cutting blocks stained with fish
      gore, with cleavers streaked with a dark, crusty red material sitting next to the decapitated and
      de-tailed fish. The fishheads and fishtails make excellent meals for the Kyerstarn husky dog population
      and ensure the dogs' give swift sled travel during times of winter.
