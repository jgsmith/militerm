    sight: >
      The start of a path leading up into the lower slopes of the northern Nolak Range begins here.
      Approximately a mile to the north, the north sea begins, sending salt spray high into the air. If it
      were not for the proximity of the coast, then trees would be able to grow here under ambient conditions
      and make a forest stretching as far as the Muskrats do to the south.
