      More sand greets your eyes as the beach hits a sharp corner. To the northeast is a gigantic, burned-out
      pine, its tangled roots poking toward the water in a futile effort to convince a passerby that it is
      still alive and kicking. A large cluster of broken &+ysandollars&* dot the water's edge, slowly being
      eroded by the waves. The beach narrows to the north as the meadow heads close to the lake, while it
      widens to the west.
