      The proprietor of this 'store' is a disproportioned, three-legged ghoul bearing a forked tongue, eye
      stalks, and a sunken hole for a nose. He readily sells his brainwashing, mind-searching, and psionic
      techniques at a considerable profit. With all the warring found here in the dark city, he never needs
      fear a lack of customers, whether they are buying or being acted upon by his disastrous methods. A chair
      with manacles and a rack of needles sticking above it appears to be the main workplace. Next to it
      stands a tray of all sort of device designed solely to pierce cranial matter and give its victim a major
      headache.
