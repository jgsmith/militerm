    sight: >
      The snowstorm falters here, not sure whether it wants to continue dumping or give up the fight for now.
      This vista overlooks the entire southern half of the Nolak Range, including the notably pointy Jaw of
      the Wolf, more commonly known as Mt. Cyllirus. A hulking shape to the north looms tall, dark, and ugly
      before your eyes. Mountain peaks surround this rocky, jutting ridge which runs along the rim of the
      Phaylax Caldera. A walkable slope leads down into the snow-filled basin below, while the ridgeline drops
      away to the southeastern Nolaks to the east. There are shadowy shapes moving in the caldera which cannot
      be readily discerned from this distance.
