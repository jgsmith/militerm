      Perhaps a great hiding place in trying to lose a party of high-strung chasers, this nook within a dead
      pine's roots provides plenty of knobs and knolls in which to reshape your back and give your butt
      permanent depressions. It encloses like a rib cage, although wood instead of bone, acting like a
      security blanket to its occupants. This tree died honorably and continues to serve while in death. On
      one of the sides of the rooty cage is a small, fairly deep &+yindentation&* filled with some rain water,
      providing you with a deep reflection.
