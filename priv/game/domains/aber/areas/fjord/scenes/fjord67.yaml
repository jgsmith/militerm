      Named after the evil spirit who guards the easterly winds, this flat, featureless black street is the
      main artery of the eastern section of the city. No commercial districts are present, since no trade
      happens here. All who inhabit this city fight for their own power and survival and make enemies on an
      hourly basis. There is a lavasmith's shop near the end of the street, where a behemoth in a fireproof
      outfit melds together lava bombs with its breath of silver fire. It gives these weapons to various
      factions in the city to help gain the favors of the minions who wage their wars.
