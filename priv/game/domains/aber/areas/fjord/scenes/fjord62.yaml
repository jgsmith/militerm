    short: The Phaylax Crater Trail
    sight: >
      Steps carved into the mountainside provide a direct means of travel to both the mountain crater and the
      acidic lake. The air reeks of sulfur dioxide and burnt carbon, and ash deposits are everywhere from the
      minor bouts of volcanic activity. Off to either side of the staircase are solidifed lava flows, hard,
      spiky, and black as night. Vision is limited by the combination of ash and condensation clouds overhead,
      but the wind brings howls to your ears, and not just of the wind.
