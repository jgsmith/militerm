    sight: >
      A good-sized area of lush bluegrass and fertile vegetation surrounds an obliquely staring statue.
      Protected from the harsh northern climate, this park was created in the honor of the guardians of the
      divine winds, which breath life from the gods into this world each time a child of any form is born, be
      it animal, vegetable, or mineral. The statue is a totem depicting the five ways of the winds and the
      core of ethereal power which they and their force represent. To the people of Kyerstarn, the winds have
      a binding contract to keep the village prosperous and healthy while the citizens maintain the lockdown
      on The Dark City and keep its influence confined to the volcano of Mount Phaylax.
