    sight: >
      The walls of this chamber are not just black, but covered in soot from all the explosions used to kill
      ghouls and get at the massive amount of jewels within the treasury. While ghouls have no use for jewels,
      they are very possessive of the things they do happen to own, and store them here. Ghouls and lizards
      compete in here mainly to enrage each other's vengeful lust on the other clan.
