    short: Hallway to the Study
    sight: >
      This is a short hallway that leads to a study. There are a few pictures hanging on the wall that you
      assume to be the Hickdale family, some of the pictures look very old and you wonder how long the
      Hickdales have owned this farm. To the east you can see a study and the hallway leads back to the west.
