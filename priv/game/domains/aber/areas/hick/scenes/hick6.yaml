    sight: >
      The road has fresh footprints in it leading to the east towards the fields, maybe someone is working out
      there? There are large trees to the south of the road that are losing their leaves covering the grass
      with orange and yellow colors. The road leads to the east and goes back to the west. To the north is the
      road to the livestock area.
