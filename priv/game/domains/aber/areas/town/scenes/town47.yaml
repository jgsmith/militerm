    sight: >
      Wildfires leap about you as a wind whips up the flames. Everything in the area seems to have been set on
      fire by a torch. Carts, equipment and occasionaly a grossly deformed body can be seen burning among the
      ruins of the camp. It seems that a furious battle has just been fought here. The only way of escape is
      back to the west.
