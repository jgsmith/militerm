    sight: >
      This dirt road starts at the town gates and heads off into the distance. On the side of the road there
      is a sign that says 300 miles to the King's castle. The road is very crowded, and you see large commerce
      caravans moving along the length of the road as far as you can see. At the corner lies a small tower.
