    sight: >
      This large, open area has many games of chance sitting in it for people who do not feel like going into
      the Brothel to use the regular Casino. To the north is yet another part of the town square, to the south
      you may enter the Town Brothel, and to the east you may enter the square near the Tavern, where much
      food is being sold.
