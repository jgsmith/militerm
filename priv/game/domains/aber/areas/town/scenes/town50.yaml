    sight: >
      The road opens into a large clearing in the woods and off in the north just visible in the blinding sun
      is the Castle of Pensalon. To your east you can smell fresh food cooking and you can even see a little
      smoke rising up from what seems to be a small campsite. The woods to the south begin to thicken around
      the road.
