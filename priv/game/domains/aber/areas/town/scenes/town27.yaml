    sight: >
      This is a large, cheery tavern where many people come to drink and even seek some entertainment from
      time to time after a long day of adventuring. The bar is made out of beautiful handcarved oak, and you
      also notice that the bar is fully stocked. Basically, you name it, you can get it here. To the north you
      may enter one of the town's small squares, to the south you could clamber behind the bar, and to the
      west you may enter the town's brothel.
