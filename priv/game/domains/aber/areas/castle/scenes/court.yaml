    short: The Central Courtyard
    sight: >
      You stand in the central courtyard of a huge and ancient castle. Flickering torches, set high around the
      walls, illuminate even the darkest corners with a reddish flickering glow. A huge archway leads north,
      its sides carved with fantastic images of dragons and fables. Arched entryways lead south, east and
      west.
