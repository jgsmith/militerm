    short: The Outer Hall
    sight: >
      You stand in the shadowy outer hall, lit only by flaming torches high out of reach on the walls. The dim
      flickering light illuminates the many doorways which lead north, south, east and west. A cold draught
      blows through the hall, from the grand, heavily carved archway, which looks out northwards across the
      courtyard, its high thick walls silhouetted in the torch light.
