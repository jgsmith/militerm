    sight: >
      This is a passageway which would be used by the King and his court if the castle defense was ever
      penetrated, to escape from the attackers, and looking at the lack of dust and cobwebs it would seem to
      have been used recently. The passage is small and dark, but probably more inviting than the wrong end of
      a sword.
