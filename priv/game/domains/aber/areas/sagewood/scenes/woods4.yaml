    sight: >
      The chaos of the trees clamoring for the light seems to have disappeared here. In the center of this
      clearing is a single, gigantic black &+Boak&*. The other plants grow away from it as if afraid of coming
      too close. &+CNorth&* and &+CWest&* lead off into the ravaged woods.
