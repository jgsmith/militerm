    sight: >
      The trees and plants here fight a never-ending battle for the light. All around you are trees choked by
      parasitic vines and creepers. The North, West, and East exits are blocked out by seemingly impassible
      walls of ancient trees. A peculiar mass of &+Bvines&* grow on a small tree to the East. The woods
      continue &+CSouth&*.
