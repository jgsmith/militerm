      The bird's singing is gone, and all about you there is an unnatural silence. The forest lacks its
      natural health and vibrance and it seems as if some dark magic has drained it. The branches form a
      canopy above so that you cannot see the sky. The forest edges out &+CWest&* and some sickly-looking
      plains are to the &+CEast&*.
