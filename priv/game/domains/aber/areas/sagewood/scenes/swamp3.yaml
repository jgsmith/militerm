    sight: >
      All around you are evil-looking plants, choking each other out in hopeless attempts to get sunlight.
      Those who loose the battle sooner than others die, and fall into the brown water up which is up to your
      knees. Sometimes you feel something slimy swim by, ready at any moment to pull you under. Exits lead
      &+CWest&* and &+CNorth&*, and neither look inviting. To the &+CEast&* and &+CSouth&* the mud seems to
      get dangerously deeper...
