    short: Foul Swamp
    sight: >
      All around you are evil-looking plants, choking each other out in hopeless attempts to get the sunlight.
      Those who loose the battle sooner than others die, and fall into the brown water which is now up to your
      knees. Sometimes you feel something slimy swim by, ready any moment to pull you under. The swamp leads
      off in all directions, &+CSouth&* looking most inviting, as it is upon dry land.
