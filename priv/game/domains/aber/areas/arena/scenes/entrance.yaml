    short: The entrance to the Arena
    sight: >
      You stand inside the secret entrance to THE arena. Either side of you, to the north and south are the
      inner walls of this hole that has been cut into the side of the cliff. This place has been magically
      protected and no violence may take place here. A few burn marks scar the walls, around small archways
      leading to the stairway up into the viewing area.
