    sight: >
      Dust floats up into the stale air as you move acorss the dry hard ground underfoot. The Southern wall
      here has a large rock chip missing from it, and the wire mesh above to protect the people watching has
      been torn open leaving a small hole. Well out of your reach. The eastern wall looks very solid and
      extends all the way to the roof.
