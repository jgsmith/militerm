      You are standing in the bathroom. Everything is made of &+wwhite&* marble--the basin, mirrors, walls,
      ceiling and floor. The &+Bwater&* in the basin is everytime clean, because a servant is responsible for
      the &+Bwater&* and is changing it after every wash of Sir Gruoch or his son. There is nothing more
      special in this room.
