    sight: >
      You have entered through the old entrance gate into a great hall. Sir Gruoch wants to impress everyone
      with his home, so the hall is built in the old baroque style. Walls are covered with thick woollen
      carpets and on the ceiling is a suggestive fresco showing a fight of two mystic giants. The floor is
      made of hard &+ymahagony&* to slow the aging. Near the gate is a small closet for robes. There is a
      mirror hanging next to the closet. It is mostly used by ladies to refresh their make-up. There is a
      living room to the north, a small door to the east or you can go west onto the staircase.
