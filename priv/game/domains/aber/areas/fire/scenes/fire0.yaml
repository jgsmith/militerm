    sight: >
      You are standing before the mighty house where Sir Gruoch is living. It was build overlooking Sundhaven
      and Haon-dor. The entrance is made of &+Wwhite&* stones and all around is covered with &+Ggrass&*. Two
      lions statues are standing on both sides of the entrance. How can someone create something so realistic
      looking? Exits lead to the north into Gruoch's house or south to the forest road.
