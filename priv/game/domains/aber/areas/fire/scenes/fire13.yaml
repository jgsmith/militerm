    sight: >
      You are standing in the laundry. It stinks a bit here. Servants wash dirty clothes for Sir Gruoch. You
      can see different objects helping servants with washing. There is no special decoration. Everything is
      made of &+ywood&*. A candlestick for eleven candles hanging on a rope tied to the ceiling is the only
      source of light here. You can go north to the hardware store, east to the food store and west onto the
      staircase.
