    sight: >
      You are standing in the &+rwine&* store. You can see barrels full of &+rwine&* and shelves full of
      bottles. Some are over 50 years old. Sir Gruoch knows how should a good glass of wine taste. He
      sometimes gets a letter from the king to send him some bottles of wine or he visits Sir Gruoch to have a
      glass &+rwine&* with him. It is quite cold here--because of the &+rwine&*, there is no special floor.
      You are standing on earth and your feet are visible in the ground. You can go east to the hardware store
      or south onto the staircase.
