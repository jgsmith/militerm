    sight: >
      You are standing in the living room used for inviting visitors. There is a &+rfireplace&* opposite the
      entrance. There are two seats made of very valuable wood and wool, and a small &+yoak&* table between
      them for drink. The floor is covered with bearskins. There are hunting trophies on walls. Sir Gruoch
      should be a very good fighter. The ceiling is decorated with wonderful frescos showing antic history.
      There are two swords and a shield hanging above the &+rfireplace&*, seemingly not used very often, and
      are in perfect condition.
