    sight: >
      You are standing in the hall. This room should also impress visitors, because it is used as a picture
      gallery. Sir Gruoch is very proud of his old kith and kin. The famous person should be Lady Gruoch who
      married in 1037 McBeth King of Scotland. There are many stories about this age and if you want, Sir
      Gruoch can talk hours about it. At the end of the long hall is the picture of his son. Sir Gruoch cares
      very much for the son, as his wife died of an unknown illness. He would start a &+mwar&* for his son.
      You can go the living room to north or west onto the staircase. There is a door to the east.
