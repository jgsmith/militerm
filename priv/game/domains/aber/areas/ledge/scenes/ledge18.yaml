    short: Old Mining Tunnel
    sight: >
      The tunnel seems to end at a rockfall where the walls collasped some time ago...hope no one was in
      there. Clearing the rockfall would do no good, as there are just too many rocks to clear and no telling
      how far it goes. There also appears to have been a lot of activity here recently. Some strands of rope,
      blindfolds, and gags remain indicating that someone was tied up and held hostage. It also indicates that
      whoever was tied up managed to break free. Just who that was or if that person got out of the mine isn't
      clear just yet. You can head back upward.
