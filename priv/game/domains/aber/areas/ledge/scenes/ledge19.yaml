    sight: >
      A nice cavern formed over thousands of years inside the side of the cliff, undiscovered until miners
      broke into it by chance. It had yet to form an outside opening along the outside wall, but it looks as
      if it was making its opening downward in the form of a chasm. You can't see the bottom, but it looks
      like it goes pretty deep. A rapidly narrowing ledge appears to jut from the wall to the west, but moving
      along that is pretty risky, considering the fact that a wrong step could mean taking a bad fall.
