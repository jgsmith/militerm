    short: Kobold Cave
    sight: >
      A bit of a musty section of cave is the home of some kobold, which is a kind of miner tribe of humanoid
      people that pretty much love dark places and hate sunlight. There's not too much to speak of in here,
      except for a few not-so-valuable trinkets. The kobold that lives here doesn't even sleep on anything
      more than a boulder! You can exit back out to the south.
