    short: Sloping Tunnel
    sight: >
      From this point in the tunnel it begins to head downward at about a forty-five degree angle. If it
      weren't for the mine cart tracks you might have slipped on a loose rock and fallen down the mine by now.
      Wouldn't it have been more fun riding in a mine cart instead of walking? The tracks continues downward
      for some unknown distance. With some effort you can make your way back up.
