    short: Old Mining Tunnel
    sight: >
      You have seemingly uncovered an enterance to an old coal mining tunnel that was buried by a rockfall
      caused by an earthquake some time ago. Large wooden beams seem to hold up the ceiling further down
      despite the splintering and cracking over time with each quake. The tunnel decends further downward to
      the east.
