    short: Underwater Cavern
    sight: >
      This underwater cavern comes to an end with an opening above you which seems to be a large air pocket or
      perhaps an hidden cavern. The light from the outside barely allows you to see where you're going in
      here, but the air pocket or cavern will be completely pitch black. A couple of sea creatures which stay
      in here during the daytime dart away from you. Escape for those who've been trying to get out of the
      cavern lies east.
