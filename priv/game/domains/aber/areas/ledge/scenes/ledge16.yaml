    sight: >
      The southern tunnel you are now treking through seems to have to been dug for a short distance until
      they broke into an sealed cave. No coal deposits were found, neither were any other kind of mineral
      except limestone and granite. You can step in this cave to the south or head back to the intersection
      north.
