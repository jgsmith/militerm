    short: Tracks Over the Gaps
    sight: >
      It appears the miners had to contend with mini-caves during their drilling. However, they still had to
      lay the tracks, so they just laid the tracks right over the gaps for make-shift bridges. Unfortunately
      the weight of the carts have left some of the railroad ties broken in the middle. You step over a couple
      of them, but there's some more ahead if you decide to continue on risking a nasty fall if you step
      wrongly. You can always starting climbing back out.
