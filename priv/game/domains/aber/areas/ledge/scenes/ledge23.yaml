      A set of railroad tracks designed for mine carts comes to an abrupt end at a large pile of gravel,
      mainly to stop runaway carts from barreling into working miners. The walls and ceiling of this part of
      the mine seems less susceptable to quakes, with some formations of stalactites to hold things together.
      A tunnel going upwards in what looks to have been hand drilled is completely out of reach due to the
      rather large gaps in the floor and the recent collapsing of sections of track going over those gaps. A
      more natural looking cavern can be entered to the east.
