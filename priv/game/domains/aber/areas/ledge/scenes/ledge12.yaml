    short: Old Mining Tunnel
    sight: >
      The tunnel continues deeper into the rock and seems to widen a little bit as there appears to an area
      ahead where miners load the minerals onto the carts to roll out. The wooden beams appear to be holding
      althought they look like they could collapse with a good jolt. Further progress can be made downward or
      else return upward.
