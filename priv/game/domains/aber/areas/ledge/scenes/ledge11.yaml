    short: Old Mining Tunnel
    sight: >
      A few broken beams make the ceiling look like it could collapse with the next tremor. You can hear drops
      of water drip from the cracks along with some other noises echoing from further down. Hmmm...looks like
      an adventure is waiting for you down there! Those who fear closed in spaces can run back outside up the
      tunnel.
