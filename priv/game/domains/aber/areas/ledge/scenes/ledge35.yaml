    sight: >
      Hundreds of years ago the level of the sea was much higher and this cavern was not much more than a
      large hole in the side of a submerged section of cliff. The wave action of the saltwater cut away at the
      rock on the inside until one underwater cavern joined up with another unsubmerged cavern, effectively
      flooding it also, and greatly enlarging its size. Now, the sea level has dropped since, draining the
      water from the higher sections but still keeping the lower sections underwater. The cavern extends
      itself to the north and east.
