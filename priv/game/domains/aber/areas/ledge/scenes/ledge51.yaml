    sight: >
      Water and kelp laps at the edge of the sand and looks to be safe for swimming and scuba-diving. Some
      children have built some sand castles, one resembles the Dwarfen Citidel. A small beach front shack lies
      nearby for rent and privacy for those wanting to watch the water.
