    short: Odor in the Cave
    sight: >
      A rather unpleasant smell seems to have taken over the scent of seawater common throughout this part of
      the cavern. More droppings along with a few carcasses can be found along the sides, and some growling
      can be heard also! If this sounds a bit unnerving to you, escape can be had to the south or else have an
      encounter with whatever it is to the north.
