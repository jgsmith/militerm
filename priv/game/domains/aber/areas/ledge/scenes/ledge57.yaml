    sight: >
      It's up to your neck now, and you feel the edge of something underneath you...looks like the floor drops
      off quite a good distance. You will either have to now climb up on a boat, dive underwater, or turn
      back. Check the skies and the wind, cause there's been many divers killed while swimming here in bad
      weather.
