    sight: >
      The water inside the cave is gentle, no current, no undertow. There is no telling how far this cave goes
      back inside the cliff, but hopefully it isn't too long. Smaller fish can be seen swimming by who have
      been hiding in here from the bigger fish. The tunnel continues west and east.
