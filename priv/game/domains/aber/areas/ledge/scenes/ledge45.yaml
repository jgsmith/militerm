    sight: >
      An underwater opening can be seen in the side of the cliff which seems to lead to an submerged cave.
      Since that scuba gear won't run out anytime soon, exploration isn't out of the question. The cave can be
      entered to the west, while swimming about the water can be done in any direction.
