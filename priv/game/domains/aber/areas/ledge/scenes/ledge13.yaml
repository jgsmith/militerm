    short: Widened Mining Area
    sight: >
      This area appears to be a staging zone for drilling tunnels in all different directions and central
      meeting place for all the miners. Old mining equipment lie abandoned and scattered about, most of it
      broken and useless. A couple of tunnels lead in different directions, one of which appears to be the
      source of some noises--the eastern tunnel. Other tunnels go north, south, and west.
