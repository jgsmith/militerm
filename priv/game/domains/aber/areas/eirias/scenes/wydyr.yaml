    sight: >
      The great door of Caer Wydyr, the Tower of Glass, is visible at last, high on the rocky base at the top
      of a steep rough-hewn flight of steps. But it is a door barred against entry by an enchantment you could
      never have imagined. Before it, spinning so fast that it is like a bright disc, hangs a gigantic
      &+Cwheel&*. There is no axle, nor any kind of support. The wheel hangs there in the air, deadly,
      forbidding approach, flashing round and round with a speed that gives out a menacing hum.
