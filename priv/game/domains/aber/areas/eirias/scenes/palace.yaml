    sight: >
      You are in the arched entrance to a courtyard. High pillared walls rise on all sides, set with tall
      nine-paned windows, and fantastic pointed towers rise above the balustraded line of the roof. Every
      window is blank, there are no faces anywhere. Before you, a narrowing stone staircase rises to a square
      pillared doorway, ornamented with carved stone scrolls and figures, and a replica of the crest of the
      leaping fish from the coach door.
