    sight: >
      You can hear nothing now except the creaking of the coachs wheels as it moves along the track. The path
      is completely overgrown, yet still visible; covered, as if to mark it from its surroundings, by a mat of
      some small creeping weed with dark green leaves. It is quite dark in here, and gloomy.
