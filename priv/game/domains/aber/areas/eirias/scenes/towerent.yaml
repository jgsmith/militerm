      Brightness is everywhere: a soft greenish light filters through the quartz- like walls of the room. It
      could be a cave of ice. But it is a cluttered, busy place, as if someone left it in a hurry, while
      preoccupied with some great complex matter. Piles of curling manuscript lie on the tables and shelves,
      and on the thick rush mat that covers the floor; against one wall an enormous heavy table is littered
      with strips of shining metal, and chunks of glass and rock, red and white, and greenish-blue, all among
      an array of gleaming tools which are obviously delicate jewelry tools.
