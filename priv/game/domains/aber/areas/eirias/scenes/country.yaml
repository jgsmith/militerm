      You get into the coach and it moves off, out of the City. Before you lie broad green fields, and a rough
      sandy road stretching brown-gold into the distance with a wood beyond. Somewhere a lark sings in the
      summer sky, a blue sky, patched here and there with puffy fair-weather clouds, the sun high amongst them
      now.
