    short: The Coach
    sight: >
      The coach begins to move as soon as you are inside. You look out of the window, into the brightness of
      the street. You are moving along a broad street lined with curving arcades of houses that seem to you
      strangely beautiful, with their clear lines and arches doors and wide-set, even windows, and walls of
      warm golden stone. Then the brightness of the sun seems to dim a little, and as you look outside to see
      why, you can see a rider following the coach. You don't know why, but you know he is evil. He gallops
      effortlessly past you and onwards towards your destination. The coach follows him, and turns into the
      entrance to a magnificent garden. It stops suddenly and you know you have arrived.
