      You pause for a moment, held by delight. The air is heavy with fragrance, and everywhere there are
      roses. Squares, triangles, circles of bright blossom patch the grass all around, red and yellow and
      white and all colours between. Before you is the entrance to an enclosed circular garden, a tall arch in
      a high hedge of tumbling red roses.
