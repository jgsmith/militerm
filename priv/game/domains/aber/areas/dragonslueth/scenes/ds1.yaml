    sight: >
      As you look around carefully you notice the walls are painted in blood, though its difficult to be sure
      in this dimly lit room. You see the only source of light coming from ahead of you. The room appears to
      be round with some highly reflective objects set into the walls. You shield your eyes from the glare to
      study the walls closer. It looks like diamonds but they are set too firmly in the wall for you to pry
      out.
