      This cave is very beautiful and magnificiant. The walls are laced with pure gold that looks like it is
      worth a fortune. The ground is made up of stone and small sapphires that sparkle when you move your
      body. There a picture of an altar painted on the wall and a nice welcome mat for your knees to rest.
