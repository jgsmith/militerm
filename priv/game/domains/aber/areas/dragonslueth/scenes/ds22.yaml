    sight: >
      Looking around you realize that this room is a very old kitchen and it doesn't have very many of the
      modern conveniences of life. No blenders or food processors. But, they have several sinks with dishes
      that have mold on them that look like they have been there for about 20 years. There are rats running
      along the ground as you wander around. The exits are &+Cup&*, &+Cwest&*, and &+Ceast&*.
