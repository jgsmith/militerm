    sight: >
      Upon your entry of this room you see a gigantic forty by forty square dance floor with rusty suits of
      armor placed everywhere on floor. They keep their eyes on your as you move around. You walk over to one
      of them and see if there is anyone inside of them, but you see nothing. The exits are to the &+Cnorth&*
      and &+Cwest&*.
