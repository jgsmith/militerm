    sight: >
      You find yourself standing inside a dark vestibule, where the walls are covered in vast cobwebs and some
      strange smears. The wind blows in from the holes of the walls, almost sounding as if there were a few
      small spirits howling their regret. To the north is a door, blackened but still in existence. Rather
      dangerous looking stairs lead upwards.
