    sight: >
      With the brownies you start approaching the structure as well. It looks like a wooden dais, on where a
      couple of beings are sitting, deep in their discussion. Behind them there stands what could be a totem
      or a statue of some kind. Yet you do not know what this all is about, but no doubt this place must be of
      great importance and sanctity for these people.
