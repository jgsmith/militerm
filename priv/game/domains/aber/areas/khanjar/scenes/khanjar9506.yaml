    sight: >
      The walls here are paneled in some wood of various deep brown tints. A large, wooden chandelier lits the
      room, making it very homely. The furniture is dominated by a tall desk close to the north wall. Behind
      it there stands a large, impressive &+Ccupboard&*. To the west is a high, arched doorway, above which a
      huge bearhead has been fastened, welcoming the customers in. Broad stairs lead up.
