    short: A Smoky Drawing-Room
    sight: >
      You have arrived at a large drawing-room where quite an amount of tobacco smoke hovers about, forcing
      you to cough loudly. Heavy chairs and tables can be seen all around. The room is full of people,
      youngsters and elders, riches and poors, all from the different social classes. There is a wide
      collection of various hunting weapons on the western wall. The room is warmed up by a massive fireplace.
