    sight: >
      You have entered into the underlevels of the ruined temple. A very strong musky odor that makes you gasp
      for air for a few seconds. Looking around this ancient stone-walled chamber you wonder just how old it
      is. A thick layer of green, slimy moss covers most of the walls. This chamber has exits leading in all
      directions.
