    sight: >
      You are in the southwestern corridor of a large catacomb. You hear a great deal of rustling coming from
      the east and wonder what can be causing all of the noise. You then hear a crunch as you step forward and
      look down to see that you have crushed a bone of another explorer, much like yourself. The corridor
      leads to the east and to the west.
