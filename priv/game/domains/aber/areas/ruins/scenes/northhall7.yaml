    sight: >
      You are travelling in a western hallway. It looks like the hallways from the north and west of the ruins
      meet here making a complete circle. The dust in the area is getting much thicker and it makes you cough
      and wheeze a little. You then start to see spots before your eyes and decide to rest for a few minutes.
      After your head clears you decide to press on. The hallway leads to the east and to the west.
