    sight: >
      You are in the northern corridor of a large catacomb. There are several blood stained bones littered
      across the floor. A very foul odor then fills your nostrils and you feel your stomach churn. You shake
      your head a little to regain your senses before contuining onward. The corridor turns to the south and
      leads to the east.
