    short: End of the Southern Hall
    sight: >
      This looks to be the end of the southern hall. The floor is very slippery from water leaking in from the
      upper level. A thick blanket of moss grows from the ceiling down the walls to the floor. You look around
      this room one more time before deciding to turn back to the north.
