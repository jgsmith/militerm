    sight: >
      You are in the southern passage in the eastern catacombs. As you walk into this new passageway an
      overwhelming stench hits you causing you to almost fall over. After you regain your senses you look
      around to find pools of blood all over the ground, and blood stains on the walls and on the ceiling. You
      wonder what could possibly have caused such a massacre. This passage leads towards the south into
      another large catacomb.
