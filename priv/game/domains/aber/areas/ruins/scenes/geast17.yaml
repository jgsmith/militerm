    sight: >
      You are in the northeastern corner of a large catacomb. You look around this area and see bones lined up
      along the walls which makes you a little nervous. What makes you even more nervous is the blood that
      covers the bones that are laying around. Looking around nervously you see that the corridor turns to the
      west and to the south.
