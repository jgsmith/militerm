    short: An Extremely Gooey Room
    sight: >
      This room is extremely gooey from the goo dripping from the ceiling. The thick, slimy goo covering the
      floor comes up to your ankles and makes you shudder from disgust. Your surroundings resemble that of a
      catacomb and you figure that this level was built several hundreds of centuries ago.
