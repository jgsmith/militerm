    short: Yet Further into the Eastern Catacomb
    sight: >
      You are still travelling in the eastern catacombs. You start to wonder if this passageway will ever end,
      or turn another direction. The stench of rotting meat is starting to make you a little dizzy. You find
      yourself having to stop and take a short breather before continuing to the east.
