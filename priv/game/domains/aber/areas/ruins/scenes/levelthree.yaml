    sight: >
      This is a rather dark and murky area and you feel a slight chill of fear run up and down your spine.
      Looking around the dimly lit area you see a few bones laying around on the floor which doesn't help your
      already nervous condition any. The catacomb has two passageways, one to the west and one to the south.
