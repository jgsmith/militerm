    sight: >
      You are travelling in a western hallway. There are loud shrieks that are driving you mad coming from all
      directions. You put your hands over your ears to stop the sound and it does. You look around the area to
      see that there is a small room to the north with an old curtain in front of it. The hallway leads to the
      east and west.
