    sight: >
      You are in the western hallway that branches off of the main ruins. Thick layers of dust cover the moss
      on the walls. Little tracks of water spread out on the floor making it a little slippery. To the north
      you see a very old tattered curtain that shadows the room behind it. The hallway leads to the west and
      to the east as well.
