    sight: >
      You are in a gigantic chamber. The domed black marble ceiling is at least fifty feet above you, carved
      with strange designs of dragons at war. Upon the walls hang beautiful crimson tapestries, priceless
      works of art. The floor is of icy blue marble, which you can see your own reflection in. Light comes
      from two large bowls of burning incense, the reflections off of the gold coins dazzling. The entire
      center of the room is taken up by a colossal pile of gold coins. But more interesting is who sits upon
      the pile of gold coins...
