      You are in a tunnel, dug by some unnatural means. The tunnel is carved through solid stone, yet the
      walls are incredibly smooth, and shows now evidence of the wall being hacked away. Torches are placed
      along with walls every twenty feet. The tunnel slopes up to the north and down to the west.
