    sight: >
      After following the path, you reach a dark and treacherous ledge. Looking around, you realize that the
      only passage up to the mountain peak is by clinging to the ledge. Suddenly, you realize that the ledge
      leads up to a momument of some kind. The only exits leading from here are up and down. Looking up, you
      notice a temple of some kind. Leading down, you notice that it leads back to the mountain pathway.
