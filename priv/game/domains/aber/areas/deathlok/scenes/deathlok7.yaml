    sight: >
      Before you lies the Temple of Death. Entry into the temple, lies to the north. Looking about you, you
      see a huge sacrifical pit that allows you to pit items in ofference to Death. Gazing around, you notice
      that the temple is well constructed in reverence of Death. Looking to your left, you see huge pillars
      that symbolize a millenia of destruction due to Death's rule over the land. Looking to your right, you
      see unknown runes that lie on the wall. Looking closer, you realize that the runes are written in Latin
      and Greek. Suddenly, you feel an evil presence forcing you to go north. Entry into the Temple means
      ultimate annhilation, but leaving the temple means Death has prevailed over you.
