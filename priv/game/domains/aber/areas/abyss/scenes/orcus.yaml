    sight: >
      This is the throne room of Orcus. Ornate tapestries with scenes of warfare and suffering cover the
      walls. On either side of the room are rows of benches guilt with gold and silver. At the far end is his
      throne, a huge construction decorated with more skulls. Behind the throne is a low archway.
