    sight: >
      This mound of rocks could have been the ancient remains of a watchtower that afforded a good view of the
      river. The far bank looks even more desolate and forbidding than the near one, it is probably a good
      thing that the river separates them. Up river, to the north, the current is much swifter as it gushes
      through a rocky narrow canyon. To the south the river wends it way slowly out of sight.
