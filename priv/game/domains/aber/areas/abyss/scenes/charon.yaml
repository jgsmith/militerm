    sight: >
      You stand on Charon's boat at the edge of the River Styx. The boat is actually little more than a raft
      propelled by polling it along the slow current. From here you could return to the eastern bank, though
      you get the feeling that few passengers do. Charon is not here now, but there is a collection box with a
      coin slot in it.
