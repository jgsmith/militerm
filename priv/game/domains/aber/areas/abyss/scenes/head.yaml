    sight: >
      This is the southern end of a bridge, which crosses a dark chasm. The bridge is made of spider webbing,
      but is far from fragile. The main cables supporting the bridge are as big as a man's forearm. It's
      enough to make you wonder what kind of spider could make such silk.
