      You are somewhere in the middle of the Netherhells prison. A chair has been placed next to a well in the
      middle of the room. The well, instead of contain- ing water, contains a fire. The fire gives off no heat
      as the flames leap from the well, and from deep within faint cries of pain can be heard.
