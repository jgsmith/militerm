    sight: >
      The inky darkness closes in on you here as you wend your way around the basalt face of this enormous
      abyssal pit. The stairway seems to go on forever as it descends to the lowest levels of the Abyss. A
      construction sign here informs you that the first 661 levels are closed for repairs... looks like you're
      in for a long walk.
