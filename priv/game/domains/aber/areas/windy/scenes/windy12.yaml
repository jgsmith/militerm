    short: East End of Ravine
    sight: >
      You have come to the eastern end of this ravine. The crumbling red walls rise around you, forming a dead
      end. Filling nearly the entire area is a smoking ruin of some kind, filled with metallic struts and
      surfaces. The debris lies at the end of a long gouge in the ground.
