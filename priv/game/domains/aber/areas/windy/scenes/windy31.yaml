    sight: >
      You can't believe what you see, you are really on a cloud. It looks like a temple for sacrifice. The
      temple belongs to the Gods of four winds and to their mighty master Cloud God. There is an altar made of
      cloud and so is the shrine too. As you look back the way you came, you don't feel very safe to try it
      the same way down again. You should possibily try to please them for some help.
