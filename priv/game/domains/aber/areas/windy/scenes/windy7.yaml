    short: Rocky Trail
    sight: >
      You are walking along a rocky trail which winds its way through the foothills. Craggy snow-covered
      mountains rise to the south, casting dark shadows across the land. A quick breeze has picked up,
      creating a high- pitched wail as it rushes through the hills.
