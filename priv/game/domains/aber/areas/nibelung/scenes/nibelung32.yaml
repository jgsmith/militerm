    sight: >
      You are in a tavern of once-reputable reputation. Now it is musty and damp, and in obvious disuse. The
      room has been cleared of tables and chairs, apparently put in storage long ago. Along the wall behind
      the bar is a large mirror, now cracked and dirty. The shelves are also bare, and some glass shards
      twinkle on the floor. Engraved on the top of the bar you read, "To be or not 2B?"
