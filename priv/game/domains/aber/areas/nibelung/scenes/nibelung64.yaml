    sight: >
      You are standing in the chapel for the castle. A small altar indicating no specific denomination is in
      one corner. Some murals adorn one wall, and a cross hangs from the ceiling behind the altar. Light
      shines in from a window on one wall. To the north is the tapestry room, east affords an exit to the
      exterior of the castle, while to the south you spy a small side yard.
