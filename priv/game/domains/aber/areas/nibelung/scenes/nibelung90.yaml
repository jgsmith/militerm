    sight: >
      The center of the room is occupied by a very large oak table, which seats about 200 people. An equal
      number of chairs runs along both sides, and an arrangement of dried flowers has been placed as a
      centerpiece. There are buckets in two corners, the function of which you would rather not think about. A
      doorway to the east leads to a large hall, and you notice the kitchens to the south.
