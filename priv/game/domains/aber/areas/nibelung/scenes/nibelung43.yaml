    sight: >
      You find yourself inside an old church. Overturned pews, smashed windows, and graffiti on the walls show
      that it has been vandalized. The altar remains intact, however, but the linens have been removed long
      ago. Off to the west you see a small picket fence, and some gravestones. To the east is a parsonage.
      With a bit of deduction, you realize that the parsonage must be for this church.
