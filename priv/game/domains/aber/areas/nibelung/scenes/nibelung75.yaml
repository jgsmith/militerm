    short: Damp Room
    sight: >
      You are in a small room, which is very damp and chilly. A breeze is coming in from a small hole off to
      one side. You notice some light coming from that direction, though not enough to see by. The purpose of
      this room is unclear, but you would venture to speculate that it was used as a means of escape in times
      of war.
