    sight: >
      There is a faint smell of ozone in the air. You are in a deep gorge below the mountain peaks, where you
      find some relief from the constant wind. There are some markings in the rocks, and some of them appear
      to have melted at some point in the near past. Apparently lightning storms are a common occurance here.
      There is a path that goes off into the peaks above you, which you could climb with only moderate
      difficulty.
