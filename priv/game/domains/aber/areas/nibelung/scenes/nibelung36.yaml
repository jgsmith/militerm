    sight: >
      There are rotting shelves along one wall, and a table is slumped in the back of the shop. The damp
      floorboards sag a bit under your weight, and the place smells dank and musty. Some jars on one of the
      shelves have exploded, their rotten contents hardened onto the wall and floor. Bits of glass lie
      scattered about.
