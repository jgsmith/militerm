      The dungeon is cold and dank, as dungeons tend to be. Some rusted shackles hang from one wall, and you
      spy a ball and chain in one corner. The floor is covered in a thin layer of green slime, making walking
      treacherous. As you look about, you notice claw marks in the floor leading towards a bench at the far
      wall, where they suddenly end.
