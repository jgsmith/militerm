    sight: >
      You find yourself in a smaller cavern than the last one, but still rather impressive. Stalagmites poke
      up from the floor here and there about the room. Several shelves have been carved into one wall,
      apparently to store small items. As you walk further into the room, you notice some bones lying about
      the floor. A few seconds later, it dawns on you that these are human bones.
