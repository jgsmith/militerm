      You are standing in a tub of ice cream...no, wait, sorry. {We apologize for the inconvenience. The
      programmer has been zapped.} Rocky Road [ take two ] You are on a cobblestone road, although upkeep has
      been minimal in recent times. Grass can be seen forcing its way through the cracks. Some brush is
      growing off to the side, but from the looks of things, it's not happy to be there.
