    sight: >
      The parsonage, like most of the other buildings in the village, is damp and musty. The air hangs heavy
      here, as if it hadn't moved in several years. The tapestries along the opposite wall are rotten and
      covered with mildew. To the west you spy a rotting church, and to the north an open doorway opens out to
      an alley of sorts.
