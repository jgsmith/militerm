      You are in a room with murals adorning the walls, depicting the great conflicts once fought by the
      knights of this castle. Some chairs and a small tapestry are arranged about a &+Rfire&*, which burns
      happily in a large stone fireplace. Some logs are stacked off to one side of the fireplace, and a poker
      hangs just off to the right.
