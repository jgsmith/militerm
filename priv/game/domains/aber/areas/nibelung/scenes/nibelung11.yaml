      The peaks of the mountains surround you, their sharp outlines cutting into the horizon. A cold wind
      bites into your exposed flesh, chilling you. The path is now covered in snow, and glare from the sun
      causes you to squint a bit. The powdery snow crunches under the tread of your boots as you proceed along
      the trail.
