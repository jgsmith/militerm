    sight: >
      The treasury seems to have been ransacked several times before. If there ever was a treasure, you can be
      sure it is long gone. Some shelves which lined the back wall are now broken or empty. A legend has been
      enscribed into one wall, apparently engraved with some spell. It reads: Whosoever partaketh of the
      wizard's delight shall not quake nor quiver at any plight.
