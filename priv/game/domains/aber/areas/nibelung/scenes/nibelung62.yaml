    sight: >
      A small, circular fountain is here, spraying water up into the air. Sun- light reflects off the surface,
      dazzling your eyes. A light breeze tugs at the spray, scattering it and causing a rainbow to appear. To
      the north you spy a courtyard, and to the west a small doorway opens into the castle proper.
