    sight: >
      As you enter this room, you can't help but notice the large coat of arms placed in one corner of the
      room. A few statues and a suit of armor are placed around the room as a form of decoration. The ceiling
      is adorned with a paint- ing of the heavens opening, and an outpouring of cherubim and seraphim adorn
      the edges. The trim of the room is a prime example of baroque architecture. To the north you notice a
      small side yard through a doorway, while the eastern exit opens out into a courtyard. An antechamber is
      through a doorway to the south, and to the west you notice a large, empty hall.
