    sight: >
      You are in a very dank, smelly, musty, {fill in adjective here}, hallway which leads to a room to the
      east, or into a damp tunnel to the west. Moss grows upon the walls, and calcite adorns the floor in
      various spots. Water is beginning to seep into your boots, wetting your toes a little.
