    sight: >
      You are in a very small room, apparently a place for the guards to sit and monitor prisoners. A small
      table and chair are in one corner, while the rest of the room is empty. Some papers, probably logbooks,
      lie scattered about the table. To the south you notice a hallway, and a few steps west would take you
      into a smaller hallway, which apparently leads to the dungeons.
