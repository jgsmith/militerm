    sight: >
      The path slopes gently up to the north. To the northeast you see the foot- hills of a large mountain
      range. It's snow-capped peaks can be seen rising up in the distance. The forest around you starts to
      thicken, and you notice a decrease in the amount of underbrush. A glance to the south reveals that the
      path splits up further on.
