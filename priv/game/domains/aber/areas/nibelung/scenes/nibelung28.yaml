      You find yourself in a boathouse of sorts. The ceiling has collapsed at one end, allowing sunlight to
      work its way into the room. Water is lapping up against the pilons, but if there ever was a boat here,
      it is long gone. The river can be seen flowing by the eastern side of the building. A bird's nest can be
      seen in one of the rafters, but it too appears to have been abandoned.
