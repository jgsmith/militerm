      Pots and pans are scattered everywhere. Some foodstuffs lie rotting on one table, and a mouse scurries
      off into a corner. A large black, cast-iron stove is along the far wall, and shelves for food storage
      line another. To the north a swinging door leads to the dining room, and to the west is a small chamber,
      apparently used for the servants.
