    sight: >
      You are standing in a dilapidated gazebo. The structure looks on the verge of collapse, and you realize
      that it wouldn't be all that bad if it did just that. A few wooden chairs remain here, but they don't
      appear strong enough to hold the band members anymore. The wood has long since lost any appeal and is
      now a dull grey color. Off to the east is a rotting old house, which looks like it is tired of standing
      there. On the doorpost you see the rusted remains of the address, "2B".
