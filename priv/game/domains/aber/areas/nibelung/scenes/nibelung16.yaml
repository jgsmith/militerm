    sight: >
      You are on a grassy path which winds its way through some of the northern foothills of the Teeth. To the
      south, the pass grows progressively difficult, but it is still possible to work your way through. The
      path narrows greatly to the north, and with a survey of the area, you see a structure off to the far
      north.
