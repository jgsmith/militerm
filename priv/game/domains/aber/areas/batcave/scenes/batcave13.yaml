      The roof of this cave is hidden high in darkness. The floor has gone from soil to hard limestone, and
      the walls are carved with intricate &+Crunes that glow faintly blue. You feel completely at ease here. A
      sense of peacefulness is strongly washing over you, and you realize how long it has been since you've
      felt safe. The floor tilts upwards to the south, and there is a small, dark opening in the eastern wall.
