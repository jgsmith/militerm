    sight: >
      You have entered a large cave. High above you, through the dim light you make out what appears to be
      hundreds of small stalactites hanging from the ceiling. There is a strong musty smell in the air which
      is almost overpowering. Belatedly you realize the smell comes from the animal droppings which cover the
      floor, and that what you thought were stalactites are actually hundreds of vampire bats.
