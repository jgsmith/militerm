    sight: >
      Blinded by an &+Wintense&N light, it takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust. You gasp in awe when
      you realize the cave walls are made up of hundreds of crystalline formations. The floor is littered with
      glittering shards of &+Wcrystals&N that have somehow broken away from the walls. Peering up at the
      ceiling, you can find no discernible light source that displays all this natural beauty.
