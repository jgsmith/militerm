    short: The Lumber Mill
    sight: >
      The operation that is set up here is a primitive sort of wood mill. This is a place where the people of
      the village can come to buy wood to make houses, furniture, and many other things that they might need.
      The wood supplies are brought into the harbor and cut to the customer's specifications at the mill. The
      floor is very dusty and you sneeze a lot as you move around. The floor beneath you echoes to your
      footsteps.
