    short: The Town Hall
    sight: >
      You are in an older wooden building that serves as the Town Hall of Miller's Corners. The floor
      underneath you is wood and creaks as you move around. The room you are in is not very large, and there
      are a few doors that seem to lead to meeting rooms. The building looks like the type of place where a
      town council would hold its meetings. Off to one corner is a long wooden table where many people can
      sit. The floor around it is well-worn and you guess that this building gets a lot of use.
