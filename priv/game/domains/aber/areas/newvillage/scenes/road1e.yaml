    sight: >
      You are to the east of the village green, off of which are the main administrative buildings of the
      town. The track you are on is of hard packed dirt and extends east and west from here. To the east is
      another path leading to the north that seems to lead to the village shops. Off to the west, the
      landscape rises and then cuts off sharply into the sea. Just to the south is the entrance to the Village
      Inn. To the north is a small village well; apparently still in use.
