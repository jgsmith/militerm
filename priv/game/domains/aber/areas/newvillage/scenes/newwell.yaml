    sight: >
      The well you are standing next to seems to be much newer than the one west of the town hall, and seems
      to still be in use. This well is not blocked off and seems to go quite a distance into the ground. You
      can hear the slight sounds of water moving below. The well is covered which makes it difficult to see
      down into it, but you can guess the depth. Somehow you think that climbing down into the well would be
      unwise.
