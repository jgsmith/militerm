    sight: >
      You are moving among many tall ships that are anchored in the harbour. There seems to be a lot of
      shipping activity in the area. Some of the ships are much larger than others, but they are all made of
      wood and very finely crafted. One of the particularly beautiful ships that catches your eye seems to be
      called "Susan". Some of the boats closer to and on the shore seem to have been there for quite a while.
      There is a tiny boat on the shore that seems to have sailed its last voyage and is now bleaching in the
      sun.
