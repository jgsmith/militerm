    short: The General Store
    sight: >
      The store is small and quaint but seems to have just about anything a person could need. The store sells
      food supplies, containers, guns, fabric, and hundreds of other little necessities. There are also
      several items in the store that are not necessities but appear to be interesting imported little items
      such as dolls and toys.
