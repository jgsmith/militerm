      You decide to lower yourself into the well and down onto the metal grate. The grate seems to be sturdy
      as you test it out with one foot and then the other. You set both feet down on the grate and relax your
      grip on the well. You study the make of the well, which seems to be made of large pieces of impermeable
      rock. The well itself looks deep, but you can't really guess its depth, as there is complete darkness
      below.
