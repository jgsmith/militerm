    sight: >
      You are standing in front of a monsterous looking castle that seems to reach up to the sky. The black
      walls block out most of the sunlight allowing only a few rays on sunlight to strike against the ground
      revealing large bushes that climb the sides of the castle walls. The drawbridge leading into the castle
      is open allowing you to see inside of the dimly lit entrance.
