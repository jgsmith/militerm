      You enter the main library, where many mages and apprentice mages are working. As you take your second
      step, a voice in your head screams, "We did not invite you in this tower to explore! We have warned you,
      now you must face the consequences!" A bolt of lightning appears out of nowhere and strikes you. You
      feel no jolt of pain. You take a look at yourself and see that you have turned into a cricket. A very
      dead cricket stuck to the bottom of a shoe.
