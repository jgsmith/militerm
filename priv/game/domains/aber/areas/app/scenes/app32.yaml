    sight: >
      You have entered the dark mage Almin's chamber. Unlike most evil masterminds, Almin does not mind
      visitors. One reason being that he believes himself to be one of the most powerful mages. The mages at
      the Tower of Sorcery believes so as well. Another reason for Almin's care freeness, is that this chamber
      is enchanted with numerous spells of protection. To the north you see a small fountain bubbling. To the
      south is Almin's treasure room. To the west is a balcony.
