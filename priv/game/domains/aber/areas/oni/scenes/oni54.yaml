    sight: >
      The small hallway gives you a good view of the tall ceilings, but you cannot see into the rest of the
      room. The ceiling shimmers from some unseen object. It could possibly be some light reflecting off
      water. There doesn't appear to be anything else of interest in this room. It is possible to go north or
      south or back west to the staircase.
