    short: Path by a River
    sight: >
      You are on an east-west path the follows the shores of a small river. The area is surrounded by a lush
      forest with plants that you are unfamiliar with. Amongst the trees you spot its various inhabitants,
      which you are equally unfamiliar with. They appear harmless, as many of them quickly dart out of view
      upon spotting you. As you look towards the north, the forest appears to grow more dark and sinister.
