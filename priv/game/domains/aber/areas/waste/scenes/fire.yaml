    sight: >
      You are standing in the center of a vast hall, lit by huge fountains of molten rock. The walls are
      carved, and inlaid with polished gold so that they reflect huge fiery figures, in a stunning almost
      life-like fashion. A huge arched doorway leads east, while to the west there is a small bronze door.
