    sight: >
      You stand on a wide golden path, set on a high ledge overlooking a huge crater. The tremendous flames
      and explosions shake the whole mountain around you, making the fiery red skies seem to vibrate and dance
      with each flash and rumble. The ledge goes back underground to the east and west.
