    short: Where the Sidewalk Ends
    sight: >
      There is a place where the sidewalk ends And before the street begins, And there the grass grows soft
      and white, And there the sun burns crimson bright, And there the moon-bird rests from his flight To cool
      in the pepermint wind. 	Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black 	And the dark street winds
      and bends. 	Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow 	We shall walk with a walk that is measured and
      slow, 	And watch where the chalk-white arrows go 	To the place where the sidewalk ends. Yes, we'll walk
      with a walk that is measured and slow, And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, For the children,
      they mark, and the children, they know The place where the sidewalk ends. 				--Shel Silverstein
      (1933-1999)
