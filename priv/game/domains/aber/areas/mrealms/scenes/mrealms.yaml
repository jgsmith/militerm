    sight: >
      You have stepped into the mortal realms, a place for mortals to come to just to get away from the harsh
      world. It is very peaceful here and you decide that you might as well take a little break from all the
      adventuring that you have been doing. There are exits in all directions, or you can go to the Temple of
      Paradise to the south and continue on your quests.
