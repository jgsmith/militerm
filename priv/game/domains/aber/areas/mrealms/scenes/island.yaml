      Remember when you were a kid and you'd ask your friends, "If you were on a desert island and could only
      have one book/tape/item/person/food, what would it be?" Well, I hope you chose wisely, because here you
      are. Snuggle up with your favourite book or favourite person, because it doesn't look like you'll be
      rescued anytime soon.
