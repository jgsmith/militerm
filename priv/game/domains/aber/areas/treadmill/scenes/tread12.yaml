      You have come upon a very large cake...a cake of dirt and rock that formed over time that looks like
      some dessert on your dinner table. This cake happens to be surrounded by a circle of trees, and it has
      been rumored that from time to time, a demonic figure emerges from the center of the cake. Hopefully it
      is nothing but just a rumor.
