      What you see here is truly strange, a short set of stairs lead down for a short distance and stop at a
      wall. For those who are superstitious, that wall phases in and out when something emerges from it,
      usually of a demonic nature. Thus it has earned its name of the devil's stairwell according to this
      urban legend. But there doesn't appear to be any good reason why this room is attached to the other.
