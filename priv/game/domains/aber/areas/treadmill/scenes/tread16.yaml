      A vast land bridge has formed at this place in the coastline between the seas and a smaller pool behind
      it. Legend has it that a ship crashed into the causeway many years ago in a dense fog and sank downward
      into a fissure beneath the water. The deceased passed into Hades through an unseen portal while some
      supernatural beings left while it was opened. It is also said that the sea life avoid this area because
      of this, fisherman were driven off once they saw SOMETHING approach them from the water. Here's to
      hoping all of this is not true.
