    sight: >
      You are standing in a large storeroom which would be packed with magical artifacts in normal times but
      it seems that the Sorceror is using their power for a large spell project that crackles from the
      top-most level of the tower. A doorway leads through to the east to the wraith room, and you tremble at
      the thought of the creature which may lie through it, a creature which has been known to slay even
      Enchanters in but a single blow...
