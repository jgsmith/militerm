    sight: >
      You find yourself in a completely black room, even light seems afraid to go here. It is completely bare
      of adornment, and even the walls wouldn't stay if they had somewhere else to lean! There is a single
      exit in the ceiling high above, and another to the south. You seem to be floating!
