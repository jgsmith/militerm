      You are standing in a small clearing deep in the forest. The thick trees press inwards from all sides,
      searching to cover this tiny gap in their mighty ranks. A huge tree lies across the clearing, apparently
      uprooted by the wind. Quite possibly this is what left the clearing in the first place.
