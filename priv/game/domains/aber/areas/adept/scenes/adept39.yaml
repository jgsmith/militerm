      Scratches on the walls depict the thousands of prisoners of war who were locked up in here and died from
      starvation. A small pile of hay that the king calls a bed for prisoners has been permanently ground into
      the cold floor. Birds also inhabit this tower, as there are cracked eggshells and nest remains all over
      the floor.
