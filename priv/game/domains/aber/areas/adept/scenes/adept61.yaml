    sight: >
      The prow of this boat juts proudly toward the land she serves. Built onto the front is the wooden
      carving of a manifestation of a local elven goddess, finished with a coat of Adept's special serum and
      sealed with tree sap. The sides extend back to the stern in a tight parabola of wave designs with the
      deckboards shining between them. The beginning of the boom rests to one side, the sails flapping loosely
      in the wind. To the east is the dock and beach, while the ship continues westward.
