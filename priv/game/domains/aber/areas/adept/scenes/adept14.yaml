    sight: >
      This is a large cobblestoned plaza near the center of Whisper City. The great stony figures of past
      citizens - prominent politicians, war heroes, undefeated lawyers, and even one of a horse named Zogo -
      stand in no particular arrangement around a larger sculpture in the middle. The centerpiece is truly a
      work of art in its craftsmanship. Three slender strips of a metal alloy not commonly used in the
      production of normal weapons and armor twine around each other elegantly in a triple helix. Squares of a
      contrasting metal have been soldered against the outside surfaces of the helix at regular intervals. A
      block of the same metal forms the base on which the sculpture and an inscription rest.
