      An enormous oven sits in a back corner behind a large glass counter stockes with freshly made bread. It
      emits tremendous amounts of heat and keeps the shop warm even in mid-winter. On the counter in front of
      the oven, white, wheat, rye, banana nut, and sourdough combine color and texture to form an appetizing
      display. In another corner lay stacks of crates and three barrels, which are marked 'FLOUR,' 'SUGAR,'
      and 'LARD.' Two baking assistants and an apprentice attend to the complex bread-making process, sweating
      profusely from the intense heat. A price list hanging from the ceiling contains every available item in
      colorful block letters.
