    short: The Garden
    sight: >
      The archway that represents the passage in and out of the garden is made of simple adobe blocks, as are
      the walls which surround the garden to a height of four feet. Guideposts along the various dug trenches
      tell what type of plant or vegetable is currently growing within that row. Leaning up against a stone
      dedication to the Axilator people are the usual gardening implements: shovel, hoe, rake, manure pile,
      and a dusty, rickety wheelbarrow. The entire area is well tended and thus provides sufficient produce
      every harvest for all the hungry souls.
