    short: Sand Dunes
    sight: >
      The coastal breezes push the salt-tasting air up the coastline and inwards over the dunes. In some
      places, the wind is strong enough to push a whole dune several inches past its point of origin. The
      dunes themselves are composed of bright, yellowish-pink, grainy particles that blow through the air and
      deposit themselves in constantly new arrangements. Seashells lay scattered haphazardly and half-buried,
      their owners having long ago abandoned them. A crab with an unknown level of hunger snaps wildly at the
      air and scrambles at a mad pace along the beach.
