    short: Climbing the Great Tree
    sight: >
      You hang on tightly to the trunk of the great tree. You think you see movement in the dark recesses of
      the creepers and mosses around you. It would be easy to climb up or down from here. On many limbs,
      clusters of round 'oak bombs' hang waiting to drop on an unsuspecting forest explorer and let loose
      their clouds of concentrated sneeze dust. Above you the tree extends itself above you at incredible
      heights.
