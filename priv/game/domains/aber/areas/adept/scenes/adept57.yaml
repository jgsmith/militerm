      You stand on the edge of the massive, windswept tabletop known to the Kengjun Elves as The Gastabel
      Plateau and to the humans as simply another aberrant lump on the face of the planet. Small particles of
      sandstone, clay, and shale fly through the open sky and skid off the edge. To the southwest, a thick fog
      hangs over the ocean, and the northeast contains a flurry of moving black objects barely recognizable as
      the human army marching around to engage the elves once more.
