      Not many people head into here, as it often contains unpleasant surprises. Your footing slips and you
      hit the ground, rolling down a small ditch of thick branches. One gouges a furrow from your neck, but
      another pierces your chest and lightly punctures the pericardium. Gasping for breath as the blood flows
      from you, your eyes close on this world forever.
