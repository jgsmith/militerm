      Horse-drawn carts cause very little traffic on the main road in this small hamlet, for it is the
      laughing and playing children who are causing most of the ruckus. Off to one side is the village well,
      deep enough to reach well below the water table and supply enough fresh water for years without drying
      up. The most common type of residence is a single, thatch-roofed, two-story cottage with whitewashed
      walls and shuttered windows. Clumps of hay and alfalfa or small arrangements of flowers frequently hang
      from those windows that are open, letting those fragrances mingle with that of freshly-bakes pies in the
      local bakery. Other various shops are opening as the sun makes its way across the sky.
