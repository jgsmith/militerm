    sight: >
      From here, people attempt to scale the near-vertical faces of the Dracwen Mountains. This has been the
      jump-off point for many of such expeditions and rescue attempts. In the hopes of getting good luck with
      their mountain-climbing skills, travelers sometimes leave small gifts in a sheltered alcove of one of
      the faces or in a nearby gully.
