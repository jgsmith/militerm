    sight: >
      A bakery lies to the north. Smoke pours from its short chimney stack while fresh-smelling steam works
      its way out the open front door and windows. Pastries and various kinds of cakes and other cream-filled
      delights line the shelves beyond the windows. Lining the road on both sides past the bakery are more of
      the simple cottages.
