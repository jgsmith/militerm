      The forest once extended to the distant coastline to the southwest and far across to the eastern reaches
      of the land, but when humans came to this country, they greatly deforested the north and northeastern
      sections. The Kengjun Elves, fearing the eventual destruction of their entire homeland, responded with
      diplomats and petitions to ease the humans from the cutting of further trees. The diplomats were never
      heard from again and the petitions burned. When the humans begin to invade the central regions, the
      Elves launched a massive counteroffensive and drove back the humans halfway to the northern border of
      their land. The castle to the east is the humans' base of operations, and the area east of that castle
      is where the decades-long fight continues even now.
