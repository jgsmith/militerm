    sight: >
      You stand upon the main deck of the elven fishing boat Seeker. She has led a long life in her journeys
      throughout the seas of the world, battling the fierce storms and sea serpents. Usually, the Seeker is
      sent out to fetch deep-sea shellfish, bass, and salmon, but recently a huge explosion of trout and
      swordfish have caught the attention of the elves and shoved the demand for fresh fish to record-high
      levels. When the ship is crewed, the first mate controls the nearby steering wheel and the petty officer
      is in the crow's nest. Several other people take hold of handling the emblazoned sails and side oars to
      control the Seeker's speed.
