      This is where the court jester resides when he is off-duty. Books of lore and comedy have been neatly
      placed on a steel rack next to the bed. A fireplace has been shaped into a mouth, and crackling flames
      silhouette the clown's face that has been drawn around the fireplace and the jester's juggling equipment
      on the mantle.
