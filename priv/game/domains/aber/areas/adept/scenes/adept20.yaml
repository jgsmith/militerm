      This is a simple weapons store offering both new and used equipment as well as the opportunity to
      receive money for weapons under a buyback plan. A man who looks big enough to be a human cousin of the
      legendary Titans finished purchasing a new boiled leather quiver full of hardened-tipped arrows. A
      lethal looking crossbow, dart system, brace of knives, and scabbard follow. Then the store's owner
      presents a repaired sword to his heavily paying customer. The man replaces his sword in the scabbard and
      leaves, stopping for a moment to pet a purring tabby that has appeared from behing the counter. The cat
      then proceeds to jump on the counter, walk to its owner, and clean itself. Kelvin the Swordmaster
      strokes the tabby's furry back and smiles at you.
