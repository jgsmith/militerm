      From the outside, this castle is seemingly huge, but its inner size suggests something else. The
      cobblestoned plaza has a fountain in each corner and tapestries tacked to the stone walls. The king of
      the land resides to the north, while the court jester and magician dwell to the west. Those enormous
      walls stand to the south.
