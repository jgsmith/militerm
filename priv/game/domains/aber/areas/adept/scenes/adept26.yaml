    sight: >
      A picket-line fence surrounds this industrial complex, complete with a guardtower. A gray, three-story
      building stands ominously against the blue sky, its puffing tower of smoke deterring any birds from
      flying overhead. The walls seem to be three feet thick, and the fortess is heavily guarded.
