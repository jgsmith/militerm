    sight: >
      On weekdays, the amount of business going on here must be enormous, for there are many hundreds of
      merchants selling their wares streetside. Tens of wagons and scores of citizens move purposefully along
      the road, occasionally jostling one another out of the way for a better look at the mercantile bazaars.
      The city is alive with a certain music, too, heard as an overtone above the general hubbub. The exit out
      is to the west, while a crossroads lies to the east.
