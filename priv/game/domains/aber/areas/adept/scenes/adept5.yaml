    sight: >
      A lush forest surrounds this clearing, allowing the sky access to this place. Seven small shrubs form a
      circle in this clearing. A &+Cstrange rock in the very middle of the circle has four stony three-pronged
      holders extending from it, each covering a cardinal point. The rock is inscribed with the markings of a
      forgotten language, but there is a picture of a cross on each holder. Within the clearing, no noise is
      present except for the actions and footsteps of those who choose to enter the ring of shrubs.
