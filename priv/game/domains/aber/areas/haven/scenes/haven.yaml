    sight: >
      After hours of trudging through the snow you come upon a tiny inn. A sign above the door says "Warm
      Haven -- Abandon Cold, All Ye Who Enter." The room is crowded with burly adventureres, shy novices, and
      the bustling of serving wenches and bar-maids trying to take everyone's orders. The main door is to the
      south, and a side-door heads west into the frozen wastes. A number of urchins are gathered around the
      crackling fire to hear tales and songs from the Bard.
