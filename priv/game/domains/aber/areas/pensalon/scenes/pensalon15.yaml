    sight: >
      The view from the top of the wall holds you in awe, as you watch the beautiful lands of Pensalon unfold
      around you. It looks like you may be able to climb to the roof of the tower. There is a large cleared
      area to the west where there is a catapult, and to the north is a small guard room.
