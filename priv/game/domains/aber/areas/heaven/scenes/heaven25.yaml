    sight: >
      Looking up, you notice that the roof is made of shields, and the rafters are spears. Breast-plates
      litter the benches. A wolf lurks at the western door, and an eagle hovers over it. A deep and wild
      looking river, Thund, roars beside Valgrind, the outer gate. Five hundred and forty doors lead off in
      different directions, but you suspect that eight hundred warriors stand behind each one, so you opt not
      to open any of them.
