    short: Southern Bank Of The Malazon
    sight: >
      You are on the southern bank of the River Malazon, if bank is the right word. There is no dry land to be
      seen, only a series of soft mudbanks and pools which are stained brown by tannin from the leaves falling
      into the water. You can head east or west along the edge of the river proper, or venture south among the
      pools.
