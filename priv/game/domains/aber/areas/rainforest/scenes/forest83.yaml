      Water, water everywhere... There seems to be no end of it. This sluggish tributary is one of the least
      of those you have seen, but in more temperate climes it would not be an insignificant feature. A dense
      thicket prevents you from heading east, but you could go around it by heading south first - the water
      near the shore is shallow enough to wade in.
