    sight: >
      You are in the uppermost branches of one of the taller trees in the rainforest, looking out over the
      vast spread of the canopy which stretches out to the horizon in all directions but to the west, where
      tall mountains and snow-capped volcanos rise up from the forests to touch the clouds. The next tree is
      too far away for you to reach, so the only way from here is down.
