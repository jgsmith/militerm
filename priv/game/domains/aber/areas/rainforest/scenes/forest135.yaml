    sight: >
      You are in a strangely still and quiet glade. There is no understorey and the canopy is continuous
      overhead, yet you can hear no sounds of birdsong or of insect chatter or of howling monkeys. The trees
      to the north and south press together so tightly that you can't help feeling you are in an avenue of
      artificial design.
