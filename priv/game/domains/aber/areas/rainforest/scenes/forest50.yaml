      You are standing on a narrow strip of sand by the edge of the river. The water is still moving fairly
      fast here, but it has a sedate quality, gliding eastward with a serene assurance. You find that you
      cannot proceed any further east here, for a tangled mass of woody plants to the south grows out into the
      river to the east.
