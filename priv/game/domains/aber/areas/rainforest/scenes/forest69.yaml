    sight: >
      You are standing by the side of yet another secluded pool. You catch a glimpse of a turtle's smooth
      shell disappearing beneath the surface of the water, and one or two silvery flashes betray the presence
      of small fish in the shallows. The pool lies to the east but you can go in any other direction.
