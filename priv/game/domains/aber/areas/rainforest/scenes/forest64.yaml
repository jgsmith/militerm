    sight: >
      You are wading through a small inlet that runs northwards from the edge of the river. The plantlife in
      this part of the rainforest is very much geared to a soggy environment, since there is no dry land in
      which to find a foothold. Instead, slender trees send wide branching roots downwards for many feet,
      burying them deep in the mud for firm anchorage, while their manifold branches intermingle with those of
      their nearest neighbours for additional support. The river lies to the south and west.
