    sight: >
      Several times here the rock gives under your feet, and you cling to the rockface in alarm. But somehow
      you manage to stay on the ledge long enough to take stock of your surroundings and ponder which way to
      go. The path bends here, heading north in one direction and in the other curving round to the west,
      following the mountainside and descending slightly.
