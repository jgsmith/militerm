      Between two bushes here a large spider's web is stretched. When you tug gently on one of the strands, a
      pair of very large, very hairy legs appears from within one of the bushes. You hastily withdraw your
      hand and, after a short while, the legs retreat. You then notice a number of packages, cocooned in silk,
      and you marvel at the size of them, then reflect on the size of their nemesis. To the east you see a
      glint of water.
