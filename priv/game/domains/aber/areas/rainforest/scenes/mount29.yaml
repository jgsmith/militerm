    sight: >
      At the top of the rock face the air is freezing. Snow-covered mountains tower around you, although you
      are so high up now that their peaks are now no more than three or four thousand feet above you. To the
      south is a broad snowfield which looks fairly safe to walk on. The only other exit is back down the
      cliff.
