    short: Bank Of The Roaring River
    sight: >
      You are careful not to get too close to the river's edge at this point, for the water is so violent that
      its limits are not constant, and every so often a sudden surge washes over the rocks on the river bank.
      At this point the river is descending in fits and bursts, yet to the east it seems to disappear over the
      edge of a cliff.
