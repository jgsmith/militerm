    sight: >
      The shore here curves inwards in a small arc, forming a bay in which the water is of uniform depth. If
      it weren't so muddy you might consider having a paddle, but the thought of vicious piranhas dissuades
      you. You can head east or west along the river bank or south into the forest.
