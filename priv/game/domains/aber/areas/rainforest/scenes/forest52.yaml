    sight: >
      You are on the bank of the River Malazon. Small trees grow out from the river's edge and overshadow the
      water. Looking down you see large fish cruising about not far beneath the surface. As fruit falls from
      the trees into the water, the fish quickly rush towards it and gobble it up. You scan the murk for signs
      of piranhas but can see none. You can go north or west along the river bank.
