    short: Edge Of The Glacier
    sight: >
      A vast river of ice is flowing past you to the south. You are on the moraine at the edge of the glacier,
      a long trail of small rocks which forms a kind of path running east and west along the glacier.
      Following it would seem to be a more sensible option than attempting a crossing here, for the surface of
      the glacier is pitted with treacherous crevasses overlaid with deceptive coverings of snow.
