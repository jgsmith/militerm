    sight: >
      The river Malazon joins the Kerapi here and the combined volume of water crawls eastwards toward the
      sea, the pale waters of the Malazon running side by side with the muddy Kerapi for many miles before
      they completely merge. You can follow the river east or head south into the forest.
