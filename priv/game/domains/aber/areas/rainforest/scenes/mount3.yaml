      You are at the end of a narrow rocky ledge which runs east from here. The only other possible route
      would be to scramble up down the mountainside, since your westward route is blocked by a sheer rockface
      which you cannot hope to pass without specialist equipment. However, you realise that once you have gone
      down, there is no way that you could manage to get back up again.
