    short: Icy Rock Face
    sight: >
      You are halfway up the rock face, clinging on for dear life, though your hands are getting exceedingly
      cold in the process. Some of your footholds are worryingly slippery owing to a thin but lethal coating
      of black ice. You can continue up or down from here.
