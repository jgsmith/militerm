    sight: >
      In stark contrast to the fury and energy of the waterfall to the west, this spot is very peaceful. The
      river here is flat and unbroken by rocks, although debris from the foothills can be seen floating by
      here and there. The flow is fairly swift, but calm and smooth, and you feel yourself relaxing under its
      soothing influence.
