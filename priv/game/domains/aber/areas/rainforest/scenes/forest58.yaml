    sight: >
      You are standing beside a narrow arc of water which does not appear to be connected to the river at all.
      Here it stagnates, once the outer edge of a wide loop of the river, now left behind by the constant
      shifting of the banks. One day, maybe, the river will reclaim it, but for now it serves little purpose
      other than to bar your way north.
