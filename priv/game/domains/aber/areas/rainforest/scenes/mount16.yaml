    sight: >
      You are standing on the side of Mount Doragua, atop a shoulder of the mountain, from where you have a
      good view of most of the range. The view to the south and west is blocked by the massive bulk of the
      mountain you are on, but you could no doubt see more if you climbed higher. However, you realise that
      higher up the air will be even colder and you are reluctant to risk hypothermia.
