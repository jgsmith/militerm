    sight: >
      The rocks here are sharp and small, yet they seem to be firmly attached and provide useful steps for you
      to plot a safe course. Below you is a narrow ledge which you should be able to reach without too much
      trouble, although once there you would not be able to return to this point. To the west a steep slope
      leads down into a gully.
