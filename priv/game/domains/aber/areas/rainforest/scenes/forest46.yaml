    sight: >
      You are pushing your way through a thick patch of undergrowth in which, you are acutely aware, many
      large insects are lurking. You notice that what you thought was a couple of leaves is now swaying from
      side to side in a strange dance while six long spiky legs protrude from either side. You feel yourself
      becoming paranoid as you start to imagine that every piece of vegetation is a weird insect in disguise.
