    short: Windswept Ridge
    sight: >
      You are standing on top of a ridge which continues west from here. At this point it is not too sharp for
      you to negotiate, but to the east it becomes a knife edge which you do not even consider as a possible
      route. Nor do you contemplate climbing down the almost vertical drop to the north. To the south the
      slope is more manageable, although your heart still pounds when you look over the edge. A much safer
      option would be to head back west.
