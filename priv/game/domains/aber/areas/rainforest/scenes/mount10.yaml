    sight: >
      You are standing on a rather slippery rock by the side of a swiftly-moving but youthful torrent which is
      flowing rapidly eastwards. Unfortunately it passes under an archway of rock to the east and you cannot
      follow its course in that direction. However you may be able to climb a little way up the slope on this
      side of the river.
