      It is hard to tell where the roots end and the trunks begin, or indeed which of the twisting lengths of
      wood are trunks and which are branches. A disordered array of woody material clambers up, down and
      sideways, making your progress very difficult. Eventually you realise you will have to concede defeat
      and head back west.
