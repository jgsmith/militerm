    short: Crossing The Glacier
    sight: >
      You are in the middle of the glacier. The ice is solid under your feet and you cast your eyes about for
      a suitable exit. You become somewhat nervous when you realise that most routes look equally dangerous.
      Perhaps to the east the ice might be fairly stable.
