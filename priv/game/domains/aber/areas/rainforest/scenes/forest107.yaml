    short: Muddy Spit
    sight: >
      A more unattractive name for a location you could not imagine, yet that is what you are standing upon -
      a short spit of hard-packed mud into which you sink only a little. It extends out into the river for a
      few yards before dipping beneath the surface. Whether it has built up over a fallen tree, long
      submerged, you have no idea, but it is certainly a product of natural rather than human effort.
