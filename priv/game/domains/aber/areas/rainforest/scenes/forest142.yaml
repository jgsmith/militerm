    sight: >
      You have come out on the other side of the fig forest! You are so relieved that you stop and rest awhile
      in thought. It is only then that you realise your progress is blocked by a tangled mass of tall thorny
      bushes so thick that it would take you a year to hack through them. You almost burst into tears as the
      knowledge sinks in that all your efforts have been in vain.
