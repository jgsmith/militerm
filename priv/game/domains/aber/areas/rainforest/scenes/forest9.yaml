    sight: >
      Spray from the raging river to the north saturates your clothes as you stand here on the bank of the
      Kerapi river. Another river has just joined it from the north, and the resultant torrent thunders past
      you with an almost deafening sound. You marvel at this mighty force of nature and at the sheer power of
      the water as it bounces down the hillside, forging a channel for itself. You could not hope to cross
      here, or even enter the water, for you would be carried away and dashed to pieces in a minute. To the
      east the river drops suddenly downhill and you can follow its bank if you wish.
