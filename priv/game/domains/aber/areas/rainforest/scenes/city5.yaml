      This is obviously the image of one of the great kings of El Dorado. Tall he stands, with a cruel smile
      on his lips. The elements have done little to touch this piece, since it is made of solid gold. Such a
      prize would make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams, if you could carry it away. Unfortunately you
      realise it must weigh several tonnes and moving it would be impossible.
