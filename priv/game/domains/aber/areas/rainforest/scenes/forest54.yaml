    sight: >
      You are standing on the northern bank of the Kerapi river, watching it flow quickly by in an easterly
      direction. To the north stretches the rainforest, dark and dense, and the calls of its denizens fill the
      air. To the east you can follow the river bank, while to the west you can climb on to a high rock by the
      water's edge.
