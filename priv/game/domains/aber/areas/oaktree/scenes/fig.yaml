    sight: >
      You are in a fig tree, under the pavilion of leaves, watching the sun move slowly through the network of
      twigs and branches, smelling the scent of flowers budding in the stalks. The fig tree seems to absorb
      you, permeate you with its gummy texture and the buzz of hornets, and you feel uneasy. To the north is a
      small olive grove.
