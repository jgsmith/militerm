    sight: >
      Here in the mansion, silver shines and lacquer glows, carved gilt chairs line the walls, sofas have legs
      like swans' necks and rest on lions' paws, and a great deal of dust spirals slowly through the air, lit
      by innumerable softly glowing candles. A marble staircase curves upwards, and you can see the gardens
      through a doorway to the west.
