    sight: >
      This tree juts out from a cliff, and through the leaves and branches you find the sea there facing you,
      calm and limpid and vast as the sky. The horizon opens wide and high and the sea-blue is stretched bare,
      without a sail. You can almost count the far-off ripples of the waves. Only a very light rustle, like a
      sigh, runs over the pebbles on the beach. There are some roots hanging over the cliff face here. They
      look fairly sturdy, and you might be able to climb down if you weren't carrying much.
