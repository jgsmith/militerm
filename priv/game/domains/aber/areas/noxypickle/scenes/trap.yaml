      This place was once a rather brutal trap. A long wooden beam with a spring-loaded spike is stuck into
      the wall, having impaled some hapless adventurer whose partially-collapsed skeleton is draped across the
      end of the spike. You scan the walls a little nervously, seeking signs of further traps, but you can see
      none.
