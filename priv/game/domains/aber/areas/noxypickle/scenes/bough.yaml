      You are scrambling among the branches of your airborne tree. You have never seen branches like these
      before: they are spongy and soft to the touch, yet they do not bend or break when you put your weight on
      them. You shake your head, trying to clear your thoughts, but the delicious smell pervades your senses
      and you eventually give in. A smile, unbidden, comes to your lips and then, to your surprise, you laugh
      out loud. You feel so happy...
