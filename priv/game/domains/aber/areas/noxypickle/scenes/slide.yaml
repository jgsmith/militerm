      You fall down, down, down through the rarified air, plunging into the cloud layer which you saw from
      above. As you continue to fall, the cloud becomes thicker and thicker, and you start to get rather wet
      from the droplets of water floating around up here. Still you fall, and the raindrops fall with you,
      growing heavier and heavier as they descend, until you find yourself in the midst of a torrent which
      plunges like a waterfall, nearly drowning you in the process. You fight a rising panic, then feel
      yourself nudging into a soft incline, which gradually becomes less and less steep as you drop. You
      slither down it on your back, carried along by the volume of water, but slowing down all the while,
      until you find yourself able to sit up and take stock of your surroundings. You are in a river, being
      gently carried towards the bank. You drift past an imposing-looking pagan temple and end up in a little
      pool beside the river bank.
