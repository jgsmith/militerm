    sight: >
      You are at the bottom of the ladder, in a small pit which is strewn with dry bones. You wonder how these
      people met their deaths, and how long ago. There is certainly no discernable smell of decay here. The
      walls are covered with the same strange markings that you saw on the archway at the top of the ladder,
      and still you have no idea what they might mean.
