    short: Floating Tree
    sight: >
      This is truly bizarre! You seem to be floating high in the air, your arms clasped around the trunk of a
      small tree. You cannot see the ground as there is a thin layer of clouds below you, blocking your view.
      A strong wind blows through the branches and roots of the tree, but you do not appear to be moving at
      all - the tree is somehow anchored in its place by an unseen force. A heady, very pleasant odour is
      making it hard for you to think straight.
