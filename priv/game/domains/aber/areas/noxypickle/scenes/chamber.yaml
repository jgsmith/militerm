    short: Looted Chamber
    sight: >
      The chamber you are in was once a place of some import, for it is well- hewn and a lot of care was put
      into its construction. Now, however, it is bare, stripped of its contents by looters. Next to the west
      wall is a hole in the floor, and a series of steps, carved into the solid rock, lead downwards into the
      darkness.
