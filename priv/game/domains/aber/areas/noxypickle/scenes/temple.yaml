    short: Temple Of Nasty Smells
    sight: >
      Inside the temple a greenish light filters through cracks in the roof. A great pendulum hangs from a
      gantry overhead, but it has long since stopped swinging. The thing that strikes you most is a powerful,
      nauseating smell which seems to be coming from the north. However, the scent of the plants outside is
      still strong enough to overcome the mind-clearing effects of this new odour.
