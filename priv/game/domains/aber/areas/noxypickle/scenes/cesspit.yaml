    short: Brink Of The Cesspit
    sight: >
      At last you have discovered the source of the terrible smell. Before you is a pit dug into the ground,
      filled to the brim with raw sewage. You reel in disgust at the reek emanating from the thick brown
      sludge before you. You cover your nose, your eyes watering, and then notice something else - several
      long, fat, worm-like creatures are swimming about in the excrement, and appear to be feeding on it! You
      feel a powerful urge to leave this place and get out among the sweet-smelling plants outside, the scent
      of which you can still faintly detect even through the sewer-stench of the cesspit. Yet another part of
      you recognises the hold the plants have over your mind, and suggests you take a much-needed bath with
      the sewer worms...
