      You are standing in the bathroom. The floor is made of white tiles and they continue also on walls to
      the height about as high as your neck. A large bath dominates the room and must be very comfortable.
      There is also a &+Csink&* with a mirror above it. Against the mirror is a second mirror, so you can see
      yourself from both sides. Don't forget the table which is used for storing towels, toothpastes, and
      toothbrushes.
