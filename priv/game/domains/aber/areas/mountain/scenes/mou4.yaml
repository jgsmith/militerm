    short: Shadow of the Cactus
    sight: >
      You take a deep reliefing breath as you find a nice seat in the shadow of a tall thorny cactus. You kick
      your shoes off and let the heat dry your sweating toes. Weak winds from the east blow gently through
      your hair and the sweat on your wet shirt slowly evaporates cooling down your back. You glance at the
      eastern skyline broken by odd structures in the distance. Paths lead east and west.
