    sight: >
      Oh MAN! This place is a sugar addicts HEAVEN! Candy wrappers line the floor, and sacks and sacks of
      goodies are piled to the ceiling. As your eyes move over the wonderous sight, they come to rest on a
      enourmous pumpkin. His body is perfectly carved, and his eyes radiate a greenish light. He is stuffing
      candy down at a great rate of speed. So, this must be the infamous Jack O' Lantern Demon!
