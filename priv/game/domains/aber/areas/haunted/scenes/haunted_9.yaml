    sight: >
      As you peer into the opening of the basement, you notice it is very hot and steamy. You proceed down the
      steps slowly. The screeching noise you heard becomes louder and louder. As you turn back and look, you
      notice that as you leave each step, the step disappears. Well, guess there is no turning back now.
