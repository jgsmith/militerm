      Talk about a sugar rush! As you walk down the path, you see the trees are made of what appear to be
      gumdrops. Little furry animals are feasting on flowers, which appear to be made of popcorn balls. As
      your eyes turn to look further west, you see the greenish glow gets brighter as you proceed.
