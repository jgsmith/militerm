      Oh MAN! This place could use some maid service! Trash is scattered all over the room, and red splashes
      cover the once white walls. The sofa and chairs are ripped up, and the TV has been thrown against the
      wall, leaving a huge hole in it. You hear a loud screeching noise coming from beneath your feet. Hmmm,
      sounds like it's coming from the basement.
