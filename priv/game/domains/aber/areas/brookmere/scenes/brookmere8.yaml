      It is cold here under the earth in this stone passageway. Walking is difficult as water drips from the
      walls and collects on the slippery stone floor, meaning that you splash softly through the gloom. The
      green glow is brighter at the west end of the corridor. A deep pool of water has collected in a dip in
      the floor and is filled with small blind cave &+Cfish&* and pale large-eyed &+Csalamanders.
