    sight: >
      Hurrying along, you find that it is actually a pleasure to walk along this corridor. The paving stones
      on the floor are smooth and even, the walls are sturdy and well made, a neat alcove has been set into
      the east wall and the roof doesn't even sag. It is in such good condition it starts to make you
      suspicious. How is it that this corridor has survived the onslaught of the hobgoblins undamaged? On the
      floor you can see some faint muddy footprints leading toward the end of the corridor, but you can find
      none leading back the other way.
