    short: The Stairs
    sight: >
      You stand at the top of some shallow, neatly carved, geometric stone steps, that lead down and to the
      east in a square spiral out of sight. There are also steps that come down to your level from the west,
      before joining the steps going down. Oddly enough, despite the fact that it isn't particularly dark in
      here you can't tell where either set of steps lead. A step on these steps would be a step into the
      unknown... There is also a narrow balcony leading around the perimeter of the stairs to an opening
      leading south, from which you can feel a slight breeze.
