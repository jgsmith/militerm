    sight: >
      Walking down the stairs, you at are at first eager to see what is at the bottom and hurry down. But
      after a long time going down, you decide that whatever is at the bottom is not worth the time and start
      to make your way back up. However, after an equally long time you are still not back in the room in
      which you started. You start to run up the stairs, striving to reach the top, but to no avail. The
      stairs just go down, or up, and around and around without going anywhere.
