    sight: >
      You have passed into an enormous cavern with a sandy floor and a fast flowing river bubbling its way
      along to the east, until it disapears beneath the cavern wall. The cavern is as high as a cathederal,
      the roof invisible in shadow, and the walls are smooth and shiny, polished over countless centuries by
      the river than now flows under them. The river has also washed sand and silt into the cavern from
      faraway riverbanks, creating a beach, and, in the middle of the river, a small island. The cavern is lit
      by lines of light scribbled on the walls of the cavern by reflections off the eddying surface of the
      water. To the west you can hear a continuous dull roar over the gurgles of the river. To the north is a
      small tunnel.
