    sight: >
      Looking down the length of this corridor you see that it tapers off sharply as it goes along. Even the
      opening you stand at is small. Fighting back claustrophobia you crouch, crawl and finally wriggle you
      way along, getting scratched and bruised by sharp rocks in the process. Towards the end of the
      `corridor' you see a luminous green glow, coming from a cave at the very end. This glow is nothing like
      that produced by the glowing fungus in the wetter parts of Brookmere. It looks ominous and creepy. You
      have a bad feeling about the cave up ahead. You couldn't say exactly why, but past experience has taught
      you to trust your intuition.
