    short: Corridor
    sight: >
      You find yourself in another corridor, cut roughly out of the earth and supported by rotting timbers.
      This corridor is unlit by the eerie green glow. The corridor opens to the north into what looks like was
      once a treasure room. Continuing to the west is a dark decrepit tunnel and to the south is another
      earthen tunnel.
