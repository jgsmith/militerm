    sight: >
      This room is long, narrow and...full of mirrors! They panel the roof, hang floor to ceiling on the walls
      and even cover the floor. Every square centimetre of the place is covered in a reflective surface.
      Looking around in wonder, you can see yourself reflected a thousand times in every direction to
      infinity. Unfortunately as you entered for the first time the door swung shut behind you, revealing
      another mirror on the back, making it impossible to find again. You find yourself trapped in a room of
      seemingly infinite proportions.
