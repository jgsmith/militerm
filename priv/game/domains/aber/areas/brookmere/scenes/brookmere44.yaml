    short: Biggish Tunnel
    sight: >
      This tunnel must have been built at the same time as the one to the east, with large, uneven stone
      boulders, but there is nothing growing between the cracks like there is in most old walls. There is only
      dirt that has been spilt on the floor near both walls, which makes you think any plant life has been
      pulled from the wall and trampled underfoot. There is a small room to the west.
