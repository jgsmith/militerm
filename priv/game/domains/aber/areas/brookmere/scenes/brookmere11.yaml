    short: Old Treasure Room
    sight: >
      You stand in a room that was once used to store elven treasure before the invasion. There are cracked
      flagstones on the floor and the walls are black with smoke from the burning of fire and torches. Any
      treasure that might have lain here has long since been stolen or hidden away. The room now marks the
      entrance to the only inhabited part of Brookmere and is empty but for a small table and a three-leegged
      stool for the guard.
