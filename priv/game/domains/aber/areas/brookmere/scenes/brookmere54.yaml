    sight: >
      A wide, dark tunnel travels a lengthy path straight ahead before curving gently to the south, cutting
      off any view of the other end save a faint green glow that makes you feel edgy. All of a sudden you feel
      the oppressive weight of the tones of earth above you, and remember that, from this point of view, the
      laws of gravity do not work in your favour.
