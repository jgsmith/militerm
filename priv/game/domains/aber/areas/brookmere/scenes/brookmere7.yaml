    short: Foot of the Rock Fall
    sight: >
      At the bottom of the rockfall you almost lose your footing on some gravel and utter a whispered curse.
      Peering into the darkness you can see two dark stone tunnels at the foot of the rock fall, one going
      east, the other, north. Looking carefully, you can see a green glow at the end of the west tunnel. To
      the north you can see only darkness.
