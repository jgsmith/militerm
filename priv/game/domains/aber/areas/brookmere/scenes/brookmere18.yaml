    short: Enormous Cavern
    sight: >
      The roof of the cavern flickers in the red light of many torches. The walls are known to learned people
      as ribbon rock, and are striped with bands of orange and red. Stalagmites and stalacties rise and
      descend out of the gloom like huge teeth that look stained with blood from the colour in the limestone.
      Centuries of dripping mineral water have created this glittering crystalised room. At the back wall of
      the cavern a fossilised &+Cwaterfall&* hangs in frozen space. A throne sits on the crest of the stone
      wave. Corridors lead east and south out of the cavern.
