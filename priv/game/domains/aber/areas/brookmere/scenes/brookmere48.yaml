    short: Orc Barracks
    sight: >
      The barracks are mostly empty and smell like a stable. Wooden bunk beds are built three high against the
      walls. The beds are unmade and armor and pieces of dirty orc underwear litter the floor. Pictures of
      female orc beauties are on the walls. A wooden table in the middle of the room is covered with torn
      cards and a set of dice made from real bones.
