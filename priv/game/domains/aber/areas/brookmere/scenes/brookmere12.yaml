    short: Decrepit Tunnel
    sight: >
      Enormous boulders, dirt and fallen timers half fill the passageway and block your path. This tunnel must
      have been this way since Brookmere fell. You push your way through the rubble and accidentally hit your
      head on a beam - the passage must be far too small for any of Brookmere's current inhabitants in this
      state. The beam shudders and dirt trickles down from the ceiling. From the looks of it the tunnel could
      collapse at any time. You decide to get out of it quickly just in case.
