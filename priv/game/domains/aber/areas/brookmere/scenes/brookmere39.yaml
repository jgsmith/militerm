    short: Soggy Corridor
    sight: >
      The corridor is a good deal wetter here, and much less pleasant that the corridor to the north. Black
      water drips fast from the walls and ceiling. You sense you are descending as the water on the floor is
      now ankle deep. A strong breeze blows, a threat to any flame. The air is damp and uncomfortable, and
      your hair is limp as it soaks up the moisture in the air. Gloomily you splash onwards, downhill to the
      west or uphill to the east.
