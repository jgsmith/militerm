    short: Lighted Corridor
    sight: >
      This corridor is well lighted and seems to be heavily traveled. It looks newly dug, indeed it appears
      that construction is still going on with several mud caked shovels lying around. Fortunately the
      corridor twists and turns, and leaves lots of places to hide in to avoid being discovered - It must be
      one of the newer tunnels, built by the orcs, goblins and gnolls, who, although inspired at war and
      carnage, are less than adequate builders.
