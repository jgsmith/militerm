    sight: >
      As you float in the lobby of the aquatic hotel you notice that it is a rather comfortable atmosphere.
      Fish swim gracefully through the lobby on their way to their rooms, a couple of merfolk up at the
      counter are checking into the hotel and a couple of swordfish children are chasing each other through
      the lobby. The lobby is tastefully decorated with carefully selected plantlife and the counter is a
      lovely shade of blue coral. Across the lobby from the counter is a small aquatic piano. You aren't quite
      certain how it operates, but it adds to the inviting atmosphere of the lobby. You may swim back out west
      to Main Street.
