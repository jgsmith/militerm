    sight: >
      You are standing in the main hub of Atlantis. All sorts of forms glide, wiggle or swim past you at
      breakneck speeds trying to reach where they are going. There are a few fish here and there swimming
      leisurely along the side of the watery street, looking into all the shops as they pass. You notice that
      the windows in the buildings are simply holes cut out from the side of them with nothing covering them,
      so occassionally a fish will dart through one of the windows in the building as well as the larger ones
      needed for larger species, like the merfolk. You can head north or south along Main Street or west to
      leave the city.
