      The water abruptly ends as you look out into a tube that is completely dry. The floor of the tube is a
      ways below but it looks like you could survive it if you decided to climb down. However, it doesn't look
      like you wold be able to climb back up if you did so. Across the tube, farther up on the opposite wall,
      you notice a smaller tube that is also filled with water.
