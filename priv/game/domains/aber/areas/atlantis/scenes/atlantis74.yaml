    sight: >
      You swim down the corridor and stop abruptly at a large door. It is a massive stone door that matches
      perfectly with the stone surrounding it. No way to pry this one open! The stone around the door and
      along the walls is slipperly smooth and reflects an ghostly glow to your eyes from somewhere. The only
      exit is either through the door somehow or back down the corridor from which you came.
