    sight: >
      The bed of the sea seems to stretch on for days. Outcroppings of rock jut up from the bottom of the sea
      floor while plant life atop it sways gently to the swell of the current. Clumps of rocks form barriers
      that smaller fish hide behind warily. Larger fish swim slowly around, looking for prey, or perhaps just
      a good place to hover quietly for a few moments. Bright colors glitter off of the rocks and fish,
      providing a delight to your eyes. Off to the east lies a kelp bed and the sea bed heads off to the
      north, south and west.
