    sight: >
      Kelp begins to grow thick here, beginning to obstruct your view of the surroundings. You push your way
      through the plants, finding your bearings. The small forest of kelp hedges in on all sides but thins out
      slightly toward the north, west and south. If you wish to try, you can attempt to force your way through
      the more tightly growning kelp to the east.
