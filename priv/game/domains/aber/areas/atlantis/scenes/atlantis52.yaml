    sight: >
      A small amount of light streams in from the water outside. In front of you is a passage through the
      stone of the cave, roughly worn into the side of the stone by the passage of water. It appears that the
      water broke through into the rough natural caves that were inside the stone here. These natural caves,
      now filled with water, lead further inside or you can swim out the cave mouth once again to the west.
