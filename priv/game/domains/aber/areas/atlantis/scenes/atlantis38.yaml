    sight: >
      You've reached the end of Main Street. A couple of dolphins pass by you chattering away happily. You
      notice a lobster patching up a hole in a building bordering the street that was worn away by the
      currents nearby. Fish dart this way and that, trying to make up their minds about what they needed to
      do. You notice a small school of fish head off to the west on a kelp trip. You can head north up Main
      Street, west down a short street or south to the Castle.
