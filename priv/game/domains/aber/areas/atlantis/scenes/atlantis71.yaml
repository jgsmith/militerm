    sight: >
      You are in a low-ceilinged, somewhat small, narrow passage. Behind you the water ceases in a clean wall
      as it meets an air tube. Looking down the tube you see a long drop with an odd shaped human-type
      creature at the bottom of the shaft. It's a long drop and if you tried to jump into the tube you would
      surely die but if you dropped something, it would probably land safely. The watery passage continues on
      further to the north.
