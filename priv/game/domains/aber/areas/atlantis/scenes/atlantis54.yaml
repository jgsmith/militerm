      The water does end abruptly here, and you drop to the floor, no longer supported by the water. Looking
      around you find yourself in a smooth cavern, that doesn't look like the rough cave passages you've seen
      earlier. The floor of the cavern is covered with sand too, instead of the hard stone tunnel floor in the
      rest of the cave passages. You can jump back into the water to the north.
