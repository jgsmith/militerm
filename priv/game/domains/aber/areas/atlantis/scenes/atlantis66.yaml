      The tunnel you have just entered hedges in closely upon you but is still sufficiently large to allow you
      comfortable passage. This tunnel also has the glassy look of the previous passage and your light slides
      off the surface in a bright glare. The tunnel continues to the north into a dead-end passage, to the
      west into another corridor and back to the south.
