    sight: >
      A large outcropping of stone stands imposingly to the south, preventing travel in that direction.
      Bubbles of of air escape around the outcropping, forced up from somewhere far below the formation. Fish
      follow the bubbles up, playing with them as they quickly rise toward the surface of the water far above
      you. You can follow the outcropping back to the west or head north along the sea bed.
