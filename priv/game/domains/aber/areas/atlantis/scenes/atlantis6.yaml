    sight: >
      This once proud cargo ship lies in ruins along the bottom of sea. From what is left you can tell that it
      was a very large vessel at one time, although much of it has washed away. Barnacles cover the wood and
      some of it looks rather unsteady, like the wood remaining was rotten clear through. Still, parts of it
      seem to be holding together quite well. The sea bed declines slightly to the east and leads into the
      wreck to the north.
