    sight: >
      There is less traffic at this end of the street. The watery passage curves gently to the east, bordered
      by buildings on the north and west. To the east you can two merpeople holding hands entering a lavish
      garden and if you look south you can see all the way down Main Street and see the Castle at the end of
      it.
