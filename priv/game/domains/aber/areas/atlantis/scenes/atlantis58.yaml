    sight: >
      Your light throws off odd shadows upon the walls and lends an eerie tint to the water before you. Ahead
      of you other shadows seem to be moving, but perhaps it's just a trick of your imagination. You can
      continue on further to the south into the shadows or north back around the corner.
