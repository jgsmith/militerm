    short: Sea Bed
    sight: >
      Actually, it doesn't resemble a bed at all. As the water swirls about you, you sway under its pressure
      and feel the crunch of sand under your feet as you attempt to keep your footing. The cliff face behind
      you is covered with all sorts of sea life and riddled full of holes, ripe for the dwellings of small
      animals. The sea bed stretches out in front of you to the north, east and south.
