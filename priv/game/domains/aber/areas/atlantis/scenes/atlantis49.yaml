      As you leave the garden behind, you notice the plant life becoming less well cultivated and that the
      coral hedges that define the path are becoming sparse. Obviously, this path is not used frequently.
      Still, you can view a shy fish or two darting in and out of the coral hedges and your eye catches a
      small lobster underneath some of the plants. You are able to swim between the hedges west back into the
      garden or east towards a cave mouth you see before you.
