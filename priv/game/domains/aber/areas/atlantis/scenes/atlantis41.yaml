    sight: >
      The courtyard is an odd congomeration of guards, servants, nobility and tourists. Off to one side of the
      courtyard you see a jellyfish talking to one of the starfish nobles. Two pagefish dart off to the side
      at a summons from their master. A number of tourists are standing around looking at all the sights of
      the castle. Plus there are peddlers selling trinkets to those around them and other fish doing
      acrobatics and feats of magic. It is a place full of merriment and activity. An opening in the crowd to
      the west leads to a sand tower and if you push your way you can swim towards some sort of opening to the
      east.
