    sight: >
      The crack that serves as the entrance appears to have been ripped open from the surrounding wall and the
      space behind it has been made into a lair for a giant squid. Bones of various creatures litter the floor
      of the crevice and it doesn't look much like a pleasant place to remain long. You can leave this place
      to the east or towards a small glimmer to the south.
