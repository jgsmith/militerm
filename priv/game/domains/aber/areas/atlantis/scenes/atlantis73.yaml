      Whew! Good thing you're small or you probably wouldn't have made it into here. The walls of this passage
      are rather narrow and a full sized human wouldn't be able to fit through here at all. Luckily that is no
      problem for you in your present state. The passage hedges in on both sides but allows you to swim to the
      north and south.
