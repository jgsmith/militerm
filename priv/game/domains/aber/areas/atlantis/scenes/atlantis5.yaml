    short: Sunken Cargo Ship
    sight: >
      The inside of the ship looks like it once was as impressive inside as it was outside. Tatters of
      tapestries still cling to the wood, swayed back and forth by the currents and fish dart here and there,
      nibbling on plant life that has attached itself to the inside of the hull. Something that resembles a
      table lies crushed on the sand while various articles are embedded like strange jewels in the sand, worn
      away beyond recognition. Strange crabs peek out at you from under a desk drawer that is propped up upon
      a rock, though the desk is nowhere to be seen. You can tell from some record books that were trapped
      under glass that this cargo ship carried something called "bottled water" that surface-dwellers seemed
      to like so much in exchange for "bottled air" that the underwater residents enjoyed.
