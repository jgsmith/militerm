    sight: >
      You find yourself at the bottom of a tube filled by an air pocket. This air pocket extends for a large
      distance above you. The floor is covered with a small layer of sand that crunches under your feet. On
      the southern wall, within jumping distance, is the hole that leads back towards the front entrance. On
      the northern wall there is a very small hole much further up than the hole on the south wall that you
      might be able to toss something up to.
