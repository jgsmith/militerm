    sight: >
      You are standing before the entrance of a cave in the mountain. Vegetation seems to die away when you
      approach the cave. You can feel evil coming from the cave. It seems to be a very dark cave. You better
      watch your soul when you're in there. A cave lies north of here. The trail goes back to the east from
      here.
