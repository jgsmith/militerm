    short: The Wading Area
    sight: >
      Moving through the wading area, the water is refreshing. Feeling a bit frisky, you splash a nearby
      child. He looks at you pathetically and goes quickly back to the edge of the pond. To the west of you,
      the pond continues, but a rope line keeps you from wading into that area.
