    short: The Wading Area
    sight: >
      Moving through the wading area, trying not to get your rolled-up pants too wet, you realize how good the
      water feels to your feet. You dip your arms in and cool your wrists. You then scoop up a little water in
      your hands and put it on the back of your neck. The water is rejuvinating, and suddenly you feel
      refreshed. To the west of you the water continues, but a rope line keeps you from wading into that area.
      You can, however, canoe around the pond if you can find a boat along the shore.
