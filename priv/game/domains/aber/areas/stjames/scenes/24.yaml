    sight: >
      Drifting near the fountain, you get a good view of its set up. There are many jets tossing water into
      the air, forming a striking pattern in the air. You feel a little mist from the fountain landing on you,
      but you are not really getting wet. In fact, the mist feels good on this hot day.
