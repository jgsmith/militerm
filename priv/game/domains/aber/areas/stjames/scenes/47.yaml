    short: Path Through St. James Park
    sight: >
      You are on the northern path through the park, west of the bridge. To the south the pond is coming to
      and end, meeting with a tall and unfriendly- looking fence around the gardens of the Palace. To the
      north, people are walking toward the palace, which is decked out in its full splendour for the V-E Day
      Celebrations.
