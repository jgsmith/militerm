    short: Path Through St. James Park
    sight: >
      You are standing west of the main entrance to St. James Park. The park stretches out to the west and
      consists of many green lawns, a pond, fountains, and two stone paths. To the north is the pond, to the
      south the green lawns, and way ahead to the west you can just make out the back wings of Buckingham
      Palace. The path is lined on both sides by green park benches.
