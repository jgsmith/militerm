    sight: >
      You are now at the northern entrance to St. James Park. There is another entrance to the south of you,
      beyond a pond. There is also a northern entrance at the western edge of the park, over where you can
      just make out the back wings of Buckingham Palace in the distance. The path you are on leads to the
      western entrance, past a pond to the south.
