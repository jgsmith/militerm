    sight: >
      Rising up next to you is a large shade tree. Its branches fan out above you, providing shade from the
      summer sun. To the north you can see a large fountain in the pond, spitting water up into the air with
      magnificent grace. Through the trees to the west you can just barely make out the back of Buckingham
      Palace.
