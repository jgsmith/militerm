    short: Between Worlds
    sight: >
      You stand in a void, between several different worlds of the Promised Land. Here you decide, which part
      of the world you wish to visit first...you see portals to the always familiar Temple of Paradise and
      Village Church. You also see portals to a council chamber, an inn, and an altar. There is also a portal
      to the Promised Land Welcome Center.
