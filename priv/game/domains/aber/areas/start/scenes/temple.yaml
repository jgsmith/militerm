    short: The Temple Of Paradise
    sight: >
      You stand in the Temple of Paradise, a huge stone structure whose walls are decorated with ancient
      carvings and runes, some so old that even the priests no longer know their meanings. A single set of
      steps lead south, descending the huge mound upon which the temple is built and ending in the forests
      below.
