      This is a small square cell in which the inhabitants of this castle put some of their junk in. The floor
      is coated with several inches of dust and dirt, and broken furniture is thrown into a large pile in the
      corner, destined to mold for all time. A large wicker torch has been tightly strapped to one wall, like
      a punishment.
