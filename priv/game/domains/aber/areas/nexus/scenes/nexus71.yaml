      The stench of death is comforting to this room. The walls are made out of pulsing human flesh, slowly
      glowing and oozing with a fresh mixture of pus and blood. Standing next to each of these open sores is a
      giant black mosquito, its probiscus deeply embedded into the wound and body pulsing in sync with the
      walls as it drinks its fill. At other spots, a shaggy-haired vampire rips away the skin covering and
      pours grapefruit directly into the muscle, sloshing it around with its tongue before ramming the entire
      length of its six inch fangs into the tear ecstatically. This room represents the heart of suffering,
      and each new wound means another victim added to the continuous torture.
