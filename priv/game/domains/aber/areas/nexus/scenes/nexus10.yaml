    short: Crystal Plain
    sight: >
      The clouds now only allow sporadic sunbeams to strike the ground as the rays of ultraviolet radiation
      desperately attempt to weave through the maze of white fluffiness. However, slivers of crystal and small
      shards are whisked away from the plain and shot up into the atmosphere by mysterious forces.
      Effortlessly, the crystal fragments are inexorably drawn into the cloud bottoms, where they vanish from
      view. All around the plain seems to be distorted slightly - the crystals warping, or maybe that is a
      trick of the sunlight.
