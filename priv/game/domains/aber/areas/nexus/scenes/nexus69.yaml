      This is a place of residence without windows. The air is deathly still, and even the loudest scream from
      the tortured sous far above do not penetrate these walls. Gargoyles are not lining the walls between the
      pictures of bad moons rising, but rather portrayed on the floor running and being swallowed whole by an
      army of nine-limbed horrors. Revulsion, insatiable hunger, and disfigurement are the way of life here.
