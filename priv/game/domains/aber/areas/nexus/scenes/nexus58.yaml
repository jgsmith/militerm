      Cries of anguish echo around as their sources writhe in unspeakable agony. Skin splits, muscles tear,
      and bones shatter and then dissolve as countless victims of innumerable species are run through
      mercilessly again and again with blades of boiling acid. They are manacled so that their backs suffer
      the burns of vertical columns of magma. Their attendants are hooded behemoths clad in flowing crimson
      robes, resembling only hulking masses silhouetted in the red glaze of the molten rock. To the north lies
      a river of magma.
