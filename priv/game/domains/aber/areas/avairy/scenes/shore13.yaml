    sight: >
      This is the western shore line of Avairy Island. To your east, dense clusters of jungle bush and trees
      block your way. The waves to the west are not as bad as most you have seen from the island. The breeze
      here is significantly weaker than that of other parts of the island and sweat begins to form on your
      forehead. The shore line continues north and south.
