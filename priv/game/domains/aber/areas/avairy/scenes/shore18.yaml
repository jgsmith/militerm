    sight: >
      You are meandering along the northern edge of the Avairy Island. The breeze coming off the sea almost
      knocks you down and you struggle to stand. Looking out over the sea you can find no sign of land. A
      large cliff shoots up to your south blocking all passage in that direction. The shoreline continues east
      and west.
