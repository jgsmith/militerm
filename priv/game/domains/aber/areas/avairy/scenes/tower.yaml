    short: Overlooking the Avairy Kingdom
    sight: >
      You are standing on a high cliff overlooking the kingdom of Avairy. In the middle is a graceful lake
      encircled by trees populated by a large number of swans. The Swan Princess speaks... 'Thank you for
      destroying that evil sorceror. Rothbart has hurt so many innocent people with his mad ambitions for
      power turning all the women into swans. With him vanquished, he cannot turn anyone else into one. But
      the spell over us cannot be broken, for we all need handsome princes to fall in love with us. Though we
      can transform into humans for a few hours in the middle of the night, we must stay at Swan Lake for our
      safety.' There is a glowing portal here, ready to send you back to where you were brought. You can't
      help but feel sorry for all the swans, yet you are only one person and could only break the spell for
      one of them.
