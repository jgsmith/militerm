    sight: >
      This is the western shore line of Avairy Island. The waves to the west are not as bad as most you have
      seen from the island. The breeze here is significantly weaker than that of other parts of the island and
      sweat begins to form on your forehead. To your east you notice that the jungle has thinned leaving a
      small path. The shore line continues north and south.
