    sight: >
      Stepping inside, you find yourself surrounded by lush, exotic greenery. Overhead, you can see a great
      expanse of sky and traces of clouds through the glass dome. The scent of tropical flowers fill your
      senses as you are soothed by the soft songs of birds flitting amid the foliage. In the center of the
      room, you see long, low, comfortable looking divans that invite you to rest your travel-weary body. On a
      marble table near one of the divans, sits a crystal bowl filled with plump, glistening strawberries.
      Next to the bowl is a chafing dish holding some warm, smooth, liquid chocolate. The whisper of water
      draws your gaze to a natural rock waterfall that spills into a deep, crystal-clear pool. A hint of steam
      rising from the surface tells you the water will be warm, soothing and most inviting. There are exits to
      the west and south.
