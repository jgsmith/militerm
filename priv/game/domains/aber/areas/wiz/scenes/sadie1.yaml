    sight: >
      As you wander across a beautiful stretch of beach, you spy a lonely beach house. Your curiousity draws
      you inside. Once there you are amazed with the beauty and peacfulness you find. On the West wall you see
      nothing but windows looking out over the most beautiful ocean you have ever seen. The waters are so
      blue, it seems like the sky has come down to touch the edge of the earth. There is a lit fireplace, with
      burning logs crackling. There are candles burning on the mantle produce a peaceful dim atmosphere about
      the room. In the shadows of light you see a soft white bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. Soft
      music is playing. You feel so at ease here. It would be easy to fall fast asleep if not careful. This
      place must belong to someone who loves the ocean very much. As you lie by the fire you hear the faint
      roar of the ocean waves outside.
