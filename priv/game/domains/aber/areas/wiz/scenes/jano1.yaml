    sight: >
      You have now somehow reached the Emerald Cloud, a brilliant crystaline forma tion floating here in the
      Heavens. You are standing on pure emerald, which is s praying a ten foot radius of soft, green light.
      You gaze in wonder at how this beauty could possibly be. In the center of this flying wonder, a small
      hot springs is dug in, letting off traces of hot wavering steam. Two small emerald pillars stand next to
      it, e ach supporting one side of a comfortable looking hammock. You get a peaceful feeling being
      suspended in free space. Looking up, the s tars seem even more brilliant than on the clearest night.
      Peering down, a chill runs down your spine as you realize just how far above the lands of Crossroads you
      really are.
