      You stand in the room of the future.You see a CD player, a full T.V. entertainment system. You see cases
      full of Hi-Tech items, the first Lightsabre, phaser and other undeciperable items. You see items from
      the past, like the rosetta stone and the Sarcophagus of King Tut. On the desk you see a computer unlike
      any you have ever seen before, it has no moniter just a little headgear thingie, IT MUST BE VIRTUAL
