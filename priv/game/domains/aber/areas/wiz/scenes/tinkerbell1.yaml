      As you approach this small abode, you can't help but wonder how someone could live in a home so small.
      As you walk through the yellowwood entry, though, you gasp in amazement. This place is HUGE! Plush red
      carpeting stretches away to the far wall stopping only to scuttle under the large comforting easy chairs
      and sofas. Red and yellow roses sit before a magnificent picture window revealing a splendid view of the
      cool blue ocean below. All in all, it looks like a very nice place to kick back, relax, and talk to your
      favourite person for hours on end!
