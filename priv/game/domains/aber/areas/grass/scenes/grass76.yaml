    sight: >
      The grasses blow in the wind about you, the sound of it moving against itself in the wind almost akin to
      someone rubbing their dry hands together in a constant, ryhtymic fashion. This place seems almost too
      peaceful as it is now, with no sound but that of the wind and nothing but open area all about you.
