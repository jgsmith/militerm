    sight: >
      Tall grasses grow in abundance, hiding the ground beneath your feet, making it hard to see whether there
      is open land ahead, a hole, whatever. It also would be quite a good cover for any would-be attackers
      should any decide to make themselves known to you for reasons of ill-faith. It is probably a very good
      idea to keep an open eye out for any predators, be they animal or humanoid.
