    sight: >
      As it turns out, the path leads downhill, although from your vantage point west of here, you could not
      tell that. It seems that the continuing brush you thought was a large field is actually tree tops! The
      path continues east, becoming more and more enclosed as you move in that direction. To the west the path
      heads uphill into a huge grassy field.
