    sight: >
      You stand amid tall grasses which stretch for some distance in all directions. The grass grows tall and
      brown, not a dead or ugly brown, simply a light windblown color which is actually quite pleasing to the
      eye. To the north is the edge of alight forested area, south is the edge of the world, or so it appears
      as all that can be seen from here is a wide, open expanse of air.
