    sight: >
      You stand amid tall grasses which stretch for some distance in all directions. The grass grows tall and
      brown, not a dead or ugly brown, simply a light windblown color which is actually quite pleasing to the
      eye. To the north is the edge of a light forested area, south is the edge of the world, or so it appears
      as all that can be seen from here is a wide, open expanse of air.
