      This is the kitchen area of Heorot. It is here where Hrothgar's cook prepares meals for all of his
      warriors. There are whole beeves hanging here waiting to be cooked for the special guests of the hall.
      The walls are lined with cooking accessories such as knives and tenderizing mallets. The only exit is
      back to the north into Heorot.
