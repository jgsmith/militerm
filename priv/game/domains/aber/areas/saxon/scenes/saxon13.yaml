    sight: >
      As you stand in the center of Heorot, your attention is immediately drawn to the south, where you notice
      a large glittering object. The tables here are covered with tablecloths, and have candles on them. This
      is where the very prestigious guests of Hrothgar sit at meal time. It is also where the men gather to
      drink, tell stories and be merry. Two fireplaces are built in to the southern walls around the exit to
      the glittering room. Exits lead in all directions.
