      In the southwestern part of Heorot lies the smaller tables of the hall. The people who serve the
      warriors food leave the large containers of beans, soup or whatever is being served here so that they
      can easily refill the plates of the warriors, who are known to eat quite a lot. After the main feast has
      taken place, the peasants and servants eat here afterwards, to show their respect for the higher
      classes. Exits lead north and east in Heorot and south into the kitchen.
