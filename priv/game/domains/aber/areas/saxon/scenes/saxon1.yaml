    sight: >
      As you stand on the rocky beach here, you see the expansion of a beautiful clear blue sea to the west of
      you. Above you towers a steep cliff which may lead to treasure and glory, or pain and loss of life.
      Seagulls call out as you take in the beauty and ponder your options.
