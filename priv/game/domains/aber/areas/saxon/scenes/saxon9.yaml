      The tall grasses abruptly end to the east, as a forest looms there. A pen has been built here, the home
      of a peasants sheep. The sheep softly murmur and whimper at their enclosure, but it is best for them.
      Such animals make a welcome feast for evil creatures of the dark which occupy the surroundings. Maybe a
      touch from a good soul would calm their fears.
