      Here in the northwestern part of Heorot is where the warriors weapons are stowed whilst they eat. There
      are racks here which contain many a sword, axe, and mace. Along the walls are large hooks from which
      suits of mail can be hung to ease ones load. A little higher up on the walls are windows from which a
      person can view the rolling prairie outside. Exits lead to the east and south.
