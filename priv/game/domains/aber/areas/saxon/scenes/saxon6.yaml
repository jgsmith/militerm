      This dirt road holds the scars of many warriors heading to their destiny. Tracks of many a man's boots
      mark the way, along with a larger, claw-like track. These large prints are fresher than the others,
      dried blood still caked in the prints of a supernatural being. To the north and east lies the grassy
      prairie, and to the south lies the grand mead hall Heorot.
