      The desert remains ever so parched further to the south. Mile after mile you plod on, your thirst
      increasing as the sun beats down relentlessly. Mirages of water wink in and out of existence before you,
      tempting your dry mouth to gobble some sand. The desert plains seem to contain almost no life, only a
      few yellowish-white handfuls of dehydrated scrub grass.
