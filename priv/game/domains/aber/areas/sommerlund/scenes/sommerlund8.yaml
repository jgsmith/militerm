      Nearby are several barns, sheds, and houses, all of which serve to run the community here and feed this
      region of the countryside. It is a place of greenery and abundant animals. To the south, acre upon acre
      of pasture and field awaits grazing and annual harvesting. Plowshares and hoes line segments of fencing
      along the trail.
