      A magnificent cottage surrounds you. Fountains of crystal-clear water and pictures of the moon decorate
      the four corners of the room. A platinum table inlaid with a full moon takes up center stage, while a
      glass chandelier hangs suspended above it. The unmistakable aura of magic is present here in great
      quantities, as permeating and as refreshing as a new breeze. Off to one side, a stained-glass aquarium
      holds fluorescent fish which change their hues every few seconds.
