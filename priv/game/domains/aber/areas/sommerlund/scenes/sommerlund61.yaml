    sight: >
      This is the void of unconsciousness which doesn't exist in your perspective. Between the realms of
      sunlight and utter twilight lies this empty abyss. The five senses of which you are so accustomed to
      crackle and distort. In here, time has no place while space is infinite, and where the power of thought
      is your only guide.
