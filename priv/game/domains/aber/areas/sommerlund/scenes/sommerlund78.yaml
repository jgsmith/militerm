    sight: >
      A vast bridge of pure black metal spans the chasm here. Despite the extreme heat, the bridge does not
      melt. The ends of it are festooned with metal spikes, preventing unauthorized transport vehicles from
      crossing. At the bottom of the chasm is a nest for a VERY large creature. It lies on a mound jutting up
      above the lava bed.
