      Here the desert begins to give way to taller grasses and even a few small trees. The dirt itself seems
      to be getting more fertile. You can pick up a handful of the soil and not choke on the dust you
      displace. To the south lies what appears to be an abandoned hut. To the north lies the unforgiving
      desert.
