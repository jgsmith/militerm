      Who would have thought that someone lived way up here in this treehouse! You stand on the deck of a
      one-room treehouse, taking in a breathtaking view of the surrounding countryside. There are now clouds
      below as well as above you, and doves flitter among the tops of the shorter trees. Whoever resides here
      certainly doesn't want company.
