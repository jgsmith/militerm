    short: Fruity Clearing
    sight: >
      You have entered a large clearing in the Tor Forest. The trees enclose you in a perfect circle, like the
      eye of a hurricane. There is fruit on every branch of every tree which immediately surrounds this
      clearing. Mainly, you see common ones such as pears and apricots, but there are also other wierdly
      shaped fruits. They could be tasty or poisonous, but you could spend your entire life gorging yourself
      silly on them and never be able to eat all of the fruit here.
