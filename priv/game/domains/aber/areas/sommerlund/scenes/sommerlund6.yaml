      This is the central bazaar for all the people on and around the desert. People come to trade their wares
      and talk about the latest gossip from the ruler of the city, who lives in a giant, pearly palace on the
      northern side. You pass stand after stand of merchants, all who try to get your attention and your
      money. There is the occasional shop set on the sides of the wide, cobblestoned streets. The mutton you
      smelled earlier emanates from a smokehouse in the center of the city. A roaring fire belches ungainly
      amounts of heavy black smoke upwards and threatens to blockade the sun. Stay for a while and enjoy the
      daily life of Ragadorn!
