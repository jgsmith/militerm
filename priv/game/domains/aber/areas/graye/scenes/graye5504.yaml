    sight: >
      The trail passes into the shade here, and the temperature drops quite suddenly. Great broad leaf trees
      gather the descending sunlight, and cover the leaf-strewn forest floor with dappled sunlight. The wagon
      trail becomes much wider here, showing signs of recent heavy use. The wagon trail runs from west to east
      here, and it looks possible to venture into the forest to the north and south.
