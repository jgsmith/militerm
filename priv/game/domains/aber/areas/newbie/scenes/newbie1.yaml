      You are standing in a large room, covered with pictures and paintings of the lands around the world. One
      large sign says 'Welcome to Promised Land!' For those of you unfamiliar with this kind of adventure
      game, an Abermud, or MUDs in general, the objective is to score points and complete quests, eventually
      reaching the level of wizard, at which point you become immortal and gain all kinds of special powers.
      Typing the words &+YINFO GAME&* will give you an overview of the game. A tour for new players begins to
      the south of here. Type &+MS&* to go south. First MUD ever players should type '&+MINFO README&*' at
      this time.
