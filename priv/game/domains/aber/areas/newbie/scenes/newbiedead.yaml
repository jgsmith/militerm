    short: Crumbling Cliff Edge
    sight: >
      You boldly go ahead into this location without thinking twice to take a look below the cliff edge, and
      the cliff COLLASPES ON YOU!!! You fall thousands of feet, smash into billions of pieces and make a small
      crater where you land! &+B---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      	&+CYou seem to have died...
      &+B--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fortunately this was all
      an illusion designed to warn you to watch where you're going. Had it been real, you would had lost
      everything and be resurrected in Between Worlds. There is a way to tell for sure if a location is
      deadly, which you will find out later. You can return to the tour west.
