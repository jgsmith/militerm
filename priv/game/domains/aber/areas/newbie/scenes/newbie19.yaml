    sight: >
      While you're running around gathering items, at some point your arms become full and you can't carry
      anymore. Other times you pillage a treasure trove full of jewels, gold, silver, and other valuables and
      need to unload it all somewhere before ending your running session. This is when you travel to one of
      the many sacificial pits in the game and drop it in to add big points to your score. But be careful, you
      want to &+YVALUE ALL&* the stuff you're carrying and avoid dropping items that aren't worth anything or
      take points away.
