    short: Zones and Quests
    sight: >
      For all these thousands of rooms, objects, and mobiles, they are grouped together into zones. The beings
      in these zones may be friendly, or hostile. Some have lots of treasure, some have lots of items to use.
      Some are good places to visit, and others you would never want to visit without good equipment--those
      usually demand a hero to defeat some evil and save someone. For information on this quest thing, read
      &+YINFO QUESTS&*. There appears to be a small lake here, maybe you should go sailing on it by taking the
      boat and going down.
