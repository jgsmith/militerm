    sight: >
      To help you start, there is a fountain from which you can drink to gain 4000 points. Type &+CLEVELS&*.
      This will show you how many points you need for each level. Drinking the fountain will take you to level
      3. To drink, simply type &+GDRINK FOUNTAIN&*. You must drink several times to reach level 3. But relax!
      You don't need to type &+GDRINK FOUNTAIN&* forty times. The command &+G! will repeat whatever your last
      command was. So type &+GDRINK FOUNTAIN&* once, then &+G!&* repeatedly or so until you get a message
      telling you that you are now a hero/heroine. If you happen to drop below level 3, you can return to the
      fountain to regain your level. &+Y If you rather just head directly into danger, go west...
