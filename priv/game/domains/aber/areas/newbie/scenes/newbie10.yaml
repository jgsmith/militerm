      It is important to keep track of your own status, especially when fighting. Type &+CSCORE&* to see how
      you are doing. If your strength ever falls below zero you will die and lose half or more of your earned
      points. Your &+CWIMPY&* value will help to prevent this by making you flee from a battle automatically
      if your strength falls below that value. Your prompt displays your stats. Some things you will notice
      right away, you start with only &+R40 hit points which alas is unplayably weak and doesn't increase with
      levels. Don't worry, we'll show you how to fix that in the next room. You will also see what your
      current level is, how many mobiles you've killed, how many times you've been slain, what wimpy is set
      at, how much money you have, how many souls you've reaped, and how much you are armored. Since you are
      starting with &+Y2000 coins, you can use it to start building your character to the north.
