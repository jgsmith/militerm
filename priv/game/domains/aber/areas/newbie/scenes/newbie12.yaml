    short: Building Yourself Up
    sight: >
      So how do you want to build your character? Buy strength? Mana? Surely you want to get your strength
      increasing with level. Firstly you should go in the gym and build up your hit points. Sam's Strength
      Center will increase your health, and if you have more health, you won't flee from battle as often.
      Whenever you enter a training center, typing &+CLEARN INFO&* will list everything they offer. To train
      yourself in a particular craft, type &+CLEARN <craft>&*. Go down now to start training your hit points.
      &+RWe strongly urge you to take the opportunity to build your character now.
