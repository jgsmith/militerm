      Most of what is known about spells are in the lost Books of Knowledge. However, this much has been
      learned. Knowledge determines your ability to cast a spell. Knowledge is acquired somehow by finding the
      twenty volumes of the Book of Knowledge. &+YINFO SPELLS&* tells about each book. The first volume of the
      Book of Knowledge has been seen in the Library behind the Cliff Window. There is a Figure which guards
      that volume, and it is believed that each volume is also guarded. The Figure will only let "real
      sorcerers" past, but it seems that his notion of a "real sorcerer" is determined entirely by what you
      wear. To gain the knowledge in the book, first you ought to &+YREAD&* what it says, then embed the book
      into your mind through &+YSTUDY <volume>&*. Be warned though, the other nineteen books are carefully
      guarded, and the ones guarding them won't let you see them without a fight. Reading these volumes is
      necessary to attain full wizhood.
