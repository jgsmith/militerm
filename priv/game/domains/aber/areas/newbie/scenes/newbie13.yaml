      Besides health, you also have the ability to cast spells. But to cast spells, you have to have mana
      points. But before you can cast spells, you have to learn those as well. Below you is Magician's Mana
      Tutoring. Though actual spells aren't taught there, they train you in gathering the magical energies to
      cast them. &+CINFO MANA&* will give more info. You may well want to save some of your coins for the many
      specials that are available around the mud. There are seven learning locations besides these two, and
      part of the game is finding them. Each learning center teaches different specials. &+YINFO SPECIALS&*
      will get you more detail on what they are. The coins to pay for continued lessons will come the first
      time you reach a level (250 coins), and the first time you solve a quest (200 coins). You can give the
      command &+YSPECIALS&* (or &+YSPEC&* for short) to see what specials you have at any time. &+ROkay then,
      go down now to train in the magical energies.
