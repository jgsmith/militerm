      There are thousands of rooms on the mud, all linked together so that you can get from here to any other
      part of the mud. The rooms are not arranged in a haphazard specific theme. Some zones contain quests
      which you will have to solve eventually, but for a beginner it is best to get a feel for the mud first
      before attempting these. There are also several different types of rooms. Some are outdoors, some are on
      water, some are underwater, some are private, some are hot, some are cold, and some will suck the life
      out of you! But the worst place to walk into is a deathroom! If you walk into a deathroom, you die and
      lose all you carry. Then you are resurrected back in Between Worlds. To avoid them, you can pick up
      clues by reading the room titles. You're standing near the edge of a cliff right now. To the east is the
      '&+RCrumbling Cliff-Edge&*', do you think it could be a deathroom?? Often the description of the room
      you are in will tell you something about your exits, so it is always a good idea to read the description
      of any room you have not been in before. To continue with the tour, go south. To retrace your steps, go
      north.
