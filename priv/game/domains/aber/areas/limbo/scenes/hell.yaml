      You are now in hell. The heat and searing flames slowly drive you mad and you start to panic a little.
      There are clawmarks on the wall from the last person that was brought here, and the pool of blood that
      you step in doesn't help your nerves any. It seems that you upset the Gods pretty well and you are now
      getting the punishment that you deserve.
