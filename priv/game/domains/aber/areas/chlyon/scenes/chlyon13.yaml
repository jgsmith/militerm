    short: The Prison
    sight: >
      You stand inside what seems to be a prison of some sorts. A huge iron gate on the north wall bars your
      progress in that direction. A plaque above the door seems to speak about a bloodthirsty monster that has
      been imprisoned in this place by the ancient gods of the land. A horrible creature, great and swift of
      foot and strong, whose breath was flame unquenchable. To the west, you can spot a legion of Thyreenean
      warriors practicing their maneuvers. Maybe you shouldn't disturb them!
