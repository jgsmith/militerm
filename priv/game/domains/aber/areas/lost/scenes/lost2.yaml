      When time was young and people still worshiped at the wooden altar this garden was planned and created
      for the enjoyment of their goddess. Painstaking care was taken to create a garden of surpassing beauty.
      The people who created and tended the garden have long since passed from the world, but the garden and
      it's peaceful beauty remain. The garden acts as an enterway into the holy grove, and many roads converge
      here.
