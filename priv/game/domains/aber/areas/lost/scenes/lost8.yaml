    sight: >
      This passageway over the northern mountains was kept by the dwarves a long time ago, but the dwarves
      have long since vanished. Their skill at working with the rock remains as a testimony to their prowess,
      as the pass remains clear after centuries of neglect. To the north you can see a building, small with
      the distance.
