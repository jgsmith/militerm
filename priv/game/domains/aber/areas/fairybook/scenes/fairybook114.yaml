    sight: >
      You notice a house larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it, many men and women are dancing.
      Five little fiddlers play as loudly as possible and the people are laughing and singing, while a big
      table nearby is loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pie and cakes, and many other food things to eat.
      The path continues east and west, and the house lies to me north.
