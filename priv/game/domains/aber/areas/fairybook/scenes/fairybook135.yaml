    sight: >
      You now come across more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers;
      and soon you find yourself in the midst of a great field of poppies. It is well-known in this country
      that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it
      falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on
      forever. You feel your eyelids drooping . . . The path continues east and west.
