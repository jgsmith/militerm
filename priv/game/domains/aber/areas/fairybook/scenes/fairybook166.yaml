    short: Atop the Wall
    sight: >
      You stand atop the wall, looking into the yard beyond. Before you is a great stretch of country having a
      floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around are many houses
      made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colours. These houses are quite small, the biggest
      of them reaching only as high as your waist. There are also pretty little barns, with china fences
      around them, and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, standing
      around in groups. But the strangest of all are the people who live in this queer country. There are
      milk-maids and shepherdesses, with bright-colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and
      princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in
      knee-breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and
      princes with jewelled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns
      in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all,
      these people are all made of china, even to their clothes, and are so small that the tallest of them is
      no higher than your knee. A ladder leads south to the China Land, and north to a strange path.
