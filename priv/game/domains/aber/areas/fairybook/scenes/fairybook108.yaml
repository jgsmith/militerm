      The garden consists of three or four scraggly flowers growing in a sun-baked clay field. Not a tree or a
      house breaks the broad sweep of flat country that reaches the edge of the sky in all directions. The
      plowed land has been baked into a grey mass, with little cracks running through it. From here, you can
      see that the sun has blistered the paint on the house, and it is now as dull and grey as everything
      else. To the west is the house.
