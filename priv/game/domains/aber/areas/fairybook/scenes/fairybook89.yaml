    sight: >
      Morning dawns over the horizon, and you see Neverland stretched out below you. You recognize parts of it
      from your dreams . . There is the lagoon, and the cave, and the pirate ship, and the mysterious river,
      and the war-path, and ahead of you you see a large clearing . . .
