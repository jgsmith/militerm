    sight: >
      You find yourself in a huge field of poppies. Your thoughts fly about your head without meaning as you
      begin to hallucinate about wicked witches on broomsticks and tin woodsmen. You feel the urge to sleep
      here, safe from the rest of the world. To the east is a field of mushrooms, and to the west the field
      becomes larger.
