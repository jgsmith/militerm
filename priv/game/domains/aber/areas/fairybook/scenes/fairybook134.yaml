      You walk along, listening to the singing of the brightly-colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers
      which have now become so thick that the ground is carpeted with them. They are big yellow and white and
      blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which are so brilliant in color
      that they almost dazzle your eyes. Their spicy scent makes you feel rather light- headed. The field
      continues west.
