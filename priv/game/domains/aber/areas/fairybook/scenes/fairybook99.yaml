    sight: >
      You stand at the dock of Kidd's Creek, overlooking the pirate ship the Jolly Roger. It lies before you,
      low in the water, a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her detestable, like ground
      strown with mangled feathers. She is the cannibal of the seas. Two huge windows dominate the rear of the
      ship, which look into Hook's cabin. At the front end of the ship is a huge skeleton, holding aloft a
      sword which slices through the sails of enemy ships. It is trimmed in black and red and swarms with
      pirates. The deck of the ship is above you, and a large clearing is to the south.
