    sight: >
      You are greeted by two great knights. Each has a large letter 'A' on his chest, and each holds a large
      weapon. The first one tells you that the throne room is to the north and the dining hall is to the
      south. The second one asks what your business is. The exit is to the east, and a bedroom is above you.
