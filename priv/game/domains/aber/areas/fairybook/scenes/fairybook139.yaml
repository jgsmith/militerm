    sight: >
      The farmhouse is well lit by emeralds, set into the ceiling. Your skin takes on an unhealthy pallor in
      this light. There is a couch in the corner, as well as a footrest. A door leads to the south, through
      which you see a green field. The west door leads to the golden path.
