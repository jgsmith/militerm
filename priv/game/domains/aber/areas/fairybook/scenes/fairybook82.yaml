      You stand on the windowledge thinking happy thoughts. Below you, in the yard, is a large english
      sheepdog, who barks at you as if to say "Come down this instant and go to bed!" But the night air smells
      of adventure, and you are too awake to sleep now. Ahead of you you can see the stars . . .
