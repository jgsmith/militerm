    sight: >
      You stand on the hard, yellow roadbed. The sun shines bright and the birds sing sweet, and you feel
      good. The country around you is very pretty. Neat fences stand at the sides of the road, painted a
      dainty blue color, and beyond them are fields of green and vegetables in abundance. To the east and west
      the path continues.
