      Marooner's Rock is a large rock sticking out of the lagoon. It is so called because Captain Hook used to
      tie prisoners up and leave them there to drown in the tide. During low tide, the mermaids relax there
      and comb out their hair. The Lost Boys often dive from the rock as well, playing among the coral reefs
      under the water. The shore lies to the west, and to the east is the nest of the Never-bird.
