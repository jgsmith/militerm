    sight: >
      A woman dressed in white is here, leaning against a tree. She looks at you oddly for a moment, and then
      begins to scream about the cut on her hand. You look, but see no blood. You wonder if she lives
      backwards . . . The path goes east and west here. You see a small building to the east and a wall to the
      west.
