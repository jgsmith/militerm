    sight: >
      You suspect this is the home of the March Hare by its appearance. The chimneys are shaped like ears and
      the roof is thatched with fur. You peer into one of the windows and see that the interior is decorated
      in early Art Deco, or else that the maid has died. A door enters the house, and a path twists behind you
      to the south.
