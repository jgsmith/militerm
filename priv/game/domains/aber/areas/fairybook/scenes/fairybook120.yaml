    sight: >
      There are no fences at all by the road anymore, and the land is rough and untilled. You come to a great
      forest, where the trees grow so big and close together that their branches meet over the road of yellow
      brick. It is almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out most of the daylight. To the east
      you see a little cottage, built of logs and branches.
