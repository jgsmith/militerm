      The door leads into a large kitchen, which is full of smoke from one end to the other. A woman sits on a
      three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby. A second woman leans over the fire, stirring a large
      cauldron which seems to be full of soup. The scent of pepper hangs heavily in the air, and a jar of it
      stands alone on a shelf. Open doors lead out to the east and the west. As you enter the room, a cat
      grins at you before vanishing entirely.
