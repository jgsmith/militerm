      You are in what was once described as 'the sweetest little room in the world', with a soft, comfortable
      bed that has sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There is a tiny fountain in the middle
      of the room, that shoots a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved
      green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stand in the windows, and there is a shelf with a row of
      little green books. A staircase leads down.
