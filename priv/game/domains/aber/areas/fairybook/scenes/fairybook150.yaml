    sight: >
      You stand at the entrance to the dark forest of the west. To the east are some fields. As soon as you
      step beneath the canopy of trees, the sun vanishes as though someone turned it off. It is rumored that
      packs of wolves, swarms of bees, and flocks of crows monitor the forest to prevent visitors from
      reaching the Witch's castle.
