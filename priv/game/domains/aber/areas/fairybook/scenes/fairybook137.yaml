    sight: >
      The road is smooth and well-paved here, and the country about is beautiful. You can see fences built
      beside the road; painted the green of the Winkies rather than the blue of the munchkins. You pass many
      houses as well, all painted green. In the distance you see a green glow. To the north and south the path
      continues.
