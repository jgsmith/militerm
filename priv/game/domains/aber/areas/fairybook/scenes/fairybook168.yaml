    sight: >
      You enter a part of the forest which is like no forest you have ever seen. Here, in the land of the
      South, nothing is as it appears. Danger lurks behind every tree. Heck, danger *is* every tree. In fact,
      the trees here seem to be moving on their own. . . The path leads north and south.
