    sight: >
      Your breath is taken away by the sight of the crystal room which you now stand in. Everything in the
      room is made of crystal, shining in the light which comes from the diamonds in the ceiling. Sitting in
      the crystal throne which dominates the opposite wall is Glinda, the Good Witch. Her shining gown dazzles
      you with its brilliance, and she asks if you are ready to go home yet. She waves a hand, and a hole
      appears in front of her. Down the hole, you can see a library. An exit goes north.
