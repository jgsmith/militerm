      The descent continues. Perhaps you will fall right through the earth? Surely they will miss you at
      dinner tonight . . . With a thump, you land in a heap of sticks and dry leaves. You jump to your feet
      and look around to find yourself in a long passage, stretching to the north. Squinting, you can barely
      make out a bobbing, white shape down the passage to the east.
