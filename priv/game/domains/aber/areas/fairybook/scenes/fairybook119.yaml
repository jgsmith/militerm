    short: Rough Path
    sight: >
      The golden path here begins to get rough, and the walking becomes difficult. The yellow bricks are here
      very uneven, sometimes broken or altogether missing. The farms are not nearly so well cared for here as
      they were further back, and the farther the path goes to the east the more dismal and lonesome the
      country becomes.
