      Dorothy's house in Kansas is small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon for several
      miles. There are four walls, a floor, and a roof, which make one room; and this room contains a rusty
      looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and two beds. A
      trap-door leads down to the cyclone cellar, a door to the east leads to the garden, and a shimmering
      door to the north goes back to the library. Suddenly, from the north, you hear a low wail of wind. A
      cyclone is coming! You run to the trapdoor, but just before you get there the house is shaken violently
      and you are thrown to the floor. The house seems to spin three or four times and rises in the air.
      Through the trap-door, you can see the ground rapidly receding. After a few hours of flight, the house
      lands with a crash.
