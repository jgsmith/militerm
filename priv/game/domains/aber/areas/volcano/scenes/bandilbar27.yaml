      You are on the path to the west of the channel. Paving stones descending into the channel disappear into
      a wide river of lava, flowing southwards and cutting off your western route. They reappear on the far
      side of the channel, heading towards a small and pleasant-looking wood. Just west from here is the
      entrance to a deep cave cut into the volcano.
