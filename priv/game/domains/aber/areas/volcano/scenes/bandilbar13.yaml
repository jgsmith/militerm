    short: South Gate Of Yorrin
    sight: >
      You are at the southern end of the village of Yorrin. A gate once stood here between two tall stone
      pillars. Now it is lying on the ground, smashed, its bars bent and broken. To the west, through the
      gate, you espy a small patch of woodland, nestling under the looming bulk of a volcano. A dark column of
      smoke rises from the summit of the volcano, and you grow uneasy at the thought of approaching it any
      closer.
