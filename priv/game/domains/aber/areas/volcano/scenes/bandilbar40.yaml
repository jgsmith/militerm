    sight: >
      You are in the chamber of the Queen ant. It smells somewhat musty to your way of thinking, and the acrid
      odour of sulphur is stronger here too. A low archway leads north into further caverns and chambers, but
      you cannot see very well. For one thing, the fumes in the air are making your eyes water. The shaking of
      the volcano as it erupts threatens to cast you from your feet.
