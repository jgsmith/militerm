      You are in the river, being carried downstream at an alarming rate! As you struggle to keep your head
      above water, you see the scenery flashing past and wonder if you will be swept all the way down to the
      sea. Suddenly, however, you are winded by a hard thud as you collide with a wooden post sticking out of
      the water. You cling to it like a drowned rat, and when you have recovered somewhat you realise that it
      is the remnants of an old wooden pier that you have washed up against.
