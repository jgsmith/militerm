      The mountain looms above you as you struggle to keep your footing in this small gully, which above you
      climbs steeply up to the path by which you came here, and levels off just below you. At this point the
      gradient is still quite steep, and gorse bushes clinging to the slope grow out at an angle. There is
      little else in the way of vegetation though, and your way is relatively unencumbered. To the south,
      still some way below you, a little-used path begins, winding westwards.
