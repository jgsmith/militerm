    sight: >
      You are standing by the edge of the river, watching as it tumbles over boulders and pours over jutting
      lips of bedrock, making its way rapidly towards the southern sea. To the north and west lie trees upon
      trees, low-growing and densely foliated. The scenery is delightful, and would be perfect if it were not
      for the distinct tinge of sulphur in the air.
