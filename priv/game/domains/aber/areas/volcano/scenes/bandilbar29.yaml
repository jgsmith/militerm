    short: Crossroads Of Tunnels
    sight: >
      You have come to a place where two tunnels meet. The main tunnel leading from the entrance descends in a
      steep decline to the west, while the tunnel running across from north to south is somewhat smaller and
      the walls less well-hewn. Torches line the walls down every tunnel, and you have no problem seeing where
      you are going.
