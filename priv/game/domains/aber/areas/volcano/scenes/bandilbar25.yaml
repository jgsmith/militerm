    sight: >
      The paving stones leading towards Mount Bandilbar are covered with a fine yellow layer of sulphur, the
      product of the volcano's foul and increasingly frequent belching. To the west the path descends into a
      channel which is now filled with a wide stream of lava, flowing north and south. Obviously you cannot
      proceed in that direction. To the north of here is a small wood.
