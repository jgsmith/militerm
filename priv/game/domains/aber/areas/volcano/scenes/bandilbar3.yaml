    sight: >
      Once upon a time this was obviously a popular road between neighbouring villages, yet now it has been
      allowed to become overgrown with weeds. To the east a tall hedge has sprung up, completely blocking the
      way. You cannot help wondering if it was planted on purpose. The road continues to the west.
