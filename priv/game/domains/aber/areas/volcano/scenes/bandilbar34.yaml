    short: Cavern Of The Worker Ants
    sight: >
      This is a curious place indeed. The cavern is vast, and in crossing it you merely skirt around the
      northern wall. Elsewhere in the cavern many strange things are happening. Giant ants tend even larger
      grubs, feeding them with piles of green leaves and being rewarded in turn by sticky secretions produced
      by the grubs. Most of the ants fortunately seem far too busy to notice you.
