    sight: >
      You are on the bridge, looking down into the fast-flowing waters. The bridge crosses the river at a
      point where the river is curving round in a wide arc which begins north-west of here. From the bridge
      onwards it straightens out and for a long while heads more or less due south. To the east the old road
      heads along the foot of the mountain, and to the west is the ever-open gate of the small village of
      Yorrin.
