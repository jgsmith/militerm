    sight: >
      You are at a bend in the tunnel. A short flight of steps leads up into some kind of cavern, but you
      cannot see much of it from here. To the east you can see a small side tunnel leading off to the north,
      then beyond it the ground rises steeply towards the entrance to the caves.
