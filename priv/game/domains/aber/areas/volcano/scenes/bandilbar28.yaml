    sight: >
      You are standing beneath a low arch marking the entrance to the network of caves inside the volcano. The
      air is warm and a sharp smell of sulphur wafts towards you from within. To the east the cave continues,
      while west of here a paved path leads down towards a deep channel running along the foot of the
      mountain.
