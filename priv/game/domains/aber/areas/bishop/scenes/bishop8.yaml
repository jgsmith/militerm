      Fierce winds pull at your clothes and hair as the vortex slowly whirls you around in circles. Lines of
      bright light emanate from various points, streaking past like sun rays or lasers, but none contain
      enough power to be threatening. Suddenly, the background drops away to reveal only a single, supportive,
      rotating disc for the vortex travelers. The wind also dies out, exposing the full nature of this
      unnatural emptiness.
