      The marsh grows much wetter here, where every footstep squishes in two inches of mud. The 'firm ground'
      consists of small mounds of stinking mire, located admist two-foot deep trenches of water. Vile methane
      swamp gas hisses forth from subterranean geysers of bubbling muck, and swamp mosquitoes buzz angrily
      around these explosions. Snakes and a few spiders are also resident here to breed within the warmth of
      the geysers. As the many trenches of the river converge into a pool, the ground suddenly drops into a
      pit, and no living thing has ever escaped from these quicksand-like holes. Vegetation is limited to
      tufts of sickly brown grass and decaying weeds. On a nearby hill of sludge, those tufts are arranged
      sporadically in a rhombus.
