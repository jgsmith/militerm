    sight: >
      A wide dirt road leads along two of the cardinal directions. Small rocks line the road to prevent
      unwanted takeovers by the surrounding grassy prairie. It is kept in seemingly good condition, as there
      are fresh rake marks within the road. Dustdevils, footprints, and wagons tend to leave the caretaker
      forever raking.
