    short: Tunnel Slope
    sight: >
      The ground here is more treacherous on a hillside as it is now. Water flows in small streams at high
      speed down the slope, washing away the loose gravel and depositing calcium compounds. As a result, the
      ground loses considerable traction, and movement can only be made safe by a tricky dance of zigzagging
      and sidestepping.
