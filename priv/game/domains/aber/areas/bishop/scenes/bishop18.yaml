      The kitchen and dining area is well-equipped with provisions, enough to feed an army and provide a
      taxidermist with a well-stuffed individual. Some cookware and ladles hang from wall hooks around a
      central stove, which is connected directly to the ceiling. A long, black pipe channels the smoke and
      steam of frying meals and boiling water to the sky. A book of recipes stands on a podium for making
      extravagant and gourmet dishes. In one corner lays the open trapdoor to a cellar.
