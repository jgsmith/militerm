    sight: >
      The western archway of the Korisla Monastery has a three-headed dragon with a bible in its mouth perched
      between the twin pairs of brick turrets. Long wicker torches freshly dipped in pitch and dried are set
      ready to provide an eternal firelight when the last traces of evil are purged from the land. Perimeter
      guards from the more war-chivalrous caste of the monastery are stationed in each turret to keep the
      order and tranquillity both within and without. Beyond the gatehouse is a garden on the inside and a
      plethora of open acreage on the outside.
