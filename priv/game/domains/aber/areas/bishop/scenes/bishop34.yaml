    short: Cemetery Gates
    sight: >
      Creaking and squeaking in the voluminous amount of wind which whips across the cemetery barrier, a
      spiked iron gate with central hump spans the distance between two cracked and chipped pillars of
      weathered stone. A rusted and broken lock on an equally rusty chain once held the two halves of the gate
      together. Above this lock is fashioned the likeness of a scaly, one-eyed lizard, its extended tongue
      letting loose flickering green lightning. These high-voltage bolt of electricity shoot diagonally
      upwards to the top of the pillars, where it is absorbed by metal balls which glow weakly with each
      influx of energy. At the base of the gate, not daring to venture into the unyielding goodness of the
      prairie, is a foot-thick layer of violently swirling gray fog.
