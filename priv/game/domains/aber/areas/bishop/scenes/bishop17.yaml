      Not many shafts of sunlight penetrate the only window in this junk-filled room - a few, small slats in a
      wooden circle. A footlocker of an approximate 45 years of age lies open to reveal old military
      dispatches, letters from long-gone people and their sweethearts, and collectibles from faraway nations.
      Quilted pillow and embroidered linens are wrapped in protective tarps and stacked neatly to one side of
      the window. The air is slightly musty, but surprisingly dust free, as if the room was swept on a daily
      basis.
