    short: Muddy Trail
    sight: >
      The southern edge of the prairie borders on a wide river going through the plains and marks the boundary
      between dry fields and marshlands. This section of the trail is a muddy mixture of dirt and clay.
      Footprints and pawprints give evidence of the small cats, rodents, and marsupials who roam this land.
