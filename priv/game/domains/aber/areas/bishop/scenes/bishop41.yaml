    short: Druid Cemetery
    sight: >
      A broken and leaf-littered pathway of dried, cracked earth wends its way among a maze of crumbling
      tombstones and moldy ground. Damp moss hangs in tatters from bare, rotting, bug-infested tree branches
      and periodically drops to be swallowed by the fog layer. Few are the musical tones generated by crickets
      when the cackling howls of banshees ride the wind. Due to a perpetual cloud of evil black smoke, the
      cemetery is kept in shrouded darkness. Green lightning pass through this cloak in sheets, flashing
      momentarily and letting the dozens of gore-stained poles staggered throughout the graveyard shine in
      dismal glory. The poles contain the bodies of Korisla monks slain in a decisive war, where each victim
      has been magically reanimated, impaled once, then folded over backwards and impaled again, forming human
      shish-ka-bobs.
