    sight: >
      The southern archway of the Korisla Monastery has a prehistoric lion with a potion of holy water in its
      mouth perched between the twin pairs of brick turrets. Long wicker torches freshly dipped in pitch and
      dried are set ready to provide an eternal firelight when the last traces of evil are purged from the
      land. Perimeter guards from the more war-chivalrous caste of the monastery are stationed in each turret
      to keep the order and tranquillity both within and without. Beyond the gatehouse is a garden on the
      inside and a plethora of open acreage on the outside.
