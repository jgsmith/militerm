      This is where the monks gather to pray on a daily basis. The wide semicircle of the alcove allows them
      to pay homage to a minor deity, the one which supports life in this area of the world. There is a marble
      altar as the centerpiece of this arrangement of stone pews with three indentations in it. However, the
      monastery's religious artifacts are not present here. Normally, the Archbishop of the monks would be
      here himself to protect to artifacts, but the bishop has gone missing for days now.
