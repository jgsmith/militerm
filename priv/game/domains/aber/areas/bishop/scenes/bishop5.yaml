    sight: >
      The ground slopes sharply downward here, pouring the running water almost in the style of a waterfall.
      The lightning on the walls flickers madly as some of it is routed through the trickling rivers. Spots of
      underground moss and lichen grow here, striped with earth tones and glowing weakly whenever a pulse of
      electricity reaches them. To the downside, the tunnel is virtually black despite the vegetation and
      lightning. From the east a swirling vortex sucks remote, trace amounts of dust into its core and tugs at
      the lichen.
