    short: Tunnel Passage
    sight: >
      A hand-carved passage wide enough for three people walking abreast runs east and west here. The stony
      walls are composed of nearly pure limestone, with the few other trace components giving off an eerie
      blue glow and an occasional flash of green lightning as an unnatural source of underground electricity
      travels through them. Along the floor by these sides, a line of spiders moves steadily away from the
      east exit, where the ground begins to slope upward. At various spots along the tunnel, a rocky crag will
      jut out and partially block the passageway like a person with a mild degree of arteriosclerosis. Water
      from underground springs and pools drains into this place and gradually eats away at the crags. This
      passage is still new, for there are no signs yet of the formation of stalactites or stalagmites.
