      Tall reeds and algae are the main forms of vegetation here, the latter surrounding islands built out of
      the former. Dry land is not always easy to find, but neither is the network of river water very deep.
      The ground is remarkably flat and allows no shelter from the cross winds that blow in from the east.
      Crawdads and skitter bugs swim the stretches of dark blue between their spawning nests and favorite
      places to gather food. Some parts of the river break off into slowly stirring eddies and pull in bits of
      plant and dirt.
