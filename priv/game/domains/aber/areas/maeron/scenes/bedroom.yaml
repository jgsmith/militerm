      This chamber is what once as Maeron's bedroom. The furniture appears to have deteriorated over the
      years, and the once colorful carpet has faded due to the rain that has come in from the &+Rsouth&*. The
      bed, which was once made of cherry wood, has fallen apart. &+WIcy winds from blizzard pass blow in from
      the south.
