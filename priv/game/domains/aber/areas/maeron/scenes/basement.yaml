    sight: >
      This chamber has a very eerie aura about it. Shadows dance off the masonry, mocking you. A spiral
      staircase leads back&+Rup&* to the relative saftey of the foyer. To the &+Rnorth&* sits a small room
      with a large ornate pedestal. A small well is in the center of the room, and it doesn't look very safe
      to go &+Rdown&* it.
