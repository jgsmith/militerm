      The stench is almost unbearable here, causing you to nearly lose your lunch. All about the floor is
      strewn gnawed on bones, rotten food, and a few things better left unmentioned. Torches light up the room
      even more brightly here, giving the room a warmth, which encourages the cockroaches' growth. To the
      &+Rnorth&* is an almost luxurious-looking room, to the &+Rwest&* a fetid kobold sleepingplace. Off to
      the &+Rsouth&* you notice the glint of something shiny.
