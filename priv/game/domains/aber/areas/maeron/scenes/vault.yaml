      This rather smallish room appears to have been untouched by the passing of time. Its reinforced iron
      walls and floor gleam under your light. This room was obviously constructed with the highest security in
      mind, as it appears nothing mortal could penetrate its defenses. You may return to the laboratory by
      heading &+RSouth&*.
