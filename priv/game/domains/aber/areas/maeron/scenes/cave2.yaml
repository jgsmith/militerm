      As you enter the cave, the scent becomes much stronger. This entire cavern reeks of the vermin.
      Flickering torches along the walls provide an eerie illumination. Myriads of rats and cockroaches
      scuttle along the floor. You may proceed even deeper into the cave by heading &+Rwest&* or leave going
      &+Reast&*.
