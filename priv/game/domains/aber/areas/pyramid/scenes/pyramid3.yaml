    sight: >
      As you wander through a sea of buff-colored &+ysand&N, waves of &+rheat &Nshimmer above the ground
      making it appear as if the dunes are alive. With each step you take, the weight of your equipment drives
      your feet deeper beneath the top layer. Just how far can you go before you are swallowed whole by a sea
      of &+ysand&N?
