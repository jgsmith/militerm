      There is a similar shrine here to the one in the King's Chamber, yet there are far more chests pushed
      against the opposite wall. Jars holding herbs, spices and oils to annoint the long-dead Queen are capped
      with fine &+Walabastar&N stoppers and sit waiting for Sitman's attendants to arise to the afterlife and
      minister to their mistresses. Through the open door, you see a smaller sarcophagus holding the body of
      the young queen.
