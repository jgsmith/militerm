      Though it was a tight fit, you managed to push between the rocks and now find yourself on a narrow,
      hard-packed trail covered with a thin layer of gritty &+ysand&N. Clearly marked in the &+ysand&N are
      dozens of tiny &+Ctracks &N made by some unknown animal. Looking off to the west, your breath lodges in
      your throat as you see endless waves of &+ysand&N that stretch clear to the horizon and beyond.
