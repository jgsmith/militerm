    sight: >
      A &+Yglided&N shrine decorates one wall, while a &+Ygolden&N statue of the goddess Selkis guards the
      four canopic jars holding the viscera of the King Amphet. At the four corners of this shrine stand the
      statues of the goddesses, Isis, Nephthys, Neith and Selkis to protect these jars from the claws of the
      greedy. Chests containing some of King Amphet's personal belongings rest against the opposite wall.
      Through the open door to the east you catch sight of a magnificent &+cquartizite&N sarcophagus, carved
      from a single block of stone.
