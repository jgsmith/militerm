    short: Shrine to Osiris
    sight: >
      A sense of awe comes over you as you step inside the shrine. The paintings covering the walls tell the
      tragic story of Osiris, once an early king who was betrayed and murdered by his brother, Set. A huge
      statue atop a long &+cquartz&N altar representing the God of the &+LDead&N, is cast of pure &+Ygold&N.
      Kneeling beneath the altar is a very large, robed Sultan come to pay homage to the powerful god.
