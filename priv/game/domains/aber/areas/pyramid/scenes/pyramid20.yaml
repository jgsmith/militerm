    sight: >
      An unpleasant odor hangs in the air. Piles of moldy garbage are strewn around the floor. Before you can
      back out of this place and continue your explorations, you spy something that looks like a hand. A chill
      skips down your spine as you notice other human remains, a toe, a part of an arm, a shriveled skull.
      Abruptly, you become aware you have stumbled across the burial chambers of mummified slaves, those
      killed to serve the dead king and queen in the afterlife. Obviously, they weren't given the same care as
      their more important counterparts.
