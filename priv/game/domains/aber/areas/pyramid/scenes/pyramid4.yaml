    sight: >
      Completely surrounded by those rippling wave of &+ysand&N, something urges you to turn back. The desert
      &+Ysun&N mercilessly beats down on you, making your eyes water, your skin burn and your mouth to go dry.
      Far to the west, you see light shimmering off what appears to be the tip of a pyramid. Excitement causes
      your heart to race in your chest. Could it be that you are close to finding the hidden tomb of
      Neferteri, high priestess to the goddess Isis? A large, multi-segmented &+ysandworm&N lies across the
      path to the west. Can you go around it or should you try to scramble up the high dune that lies to the
      north?
