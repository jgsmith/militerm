      The huge sarcophagus dominates the room. The rose granite lid looks heavy, almost impossible to move. At
      each corner the guardian goddess Isis, Nephtys, Neith and Selkis are beautifully carved in high relief,
      their arms and wings clasping the sarcophagus in a protective embrace. &+mHieroglyphs&N have been carved
      into the side of the tomb. Thoughts of the wealth that might lie with the king make you wonder if you
      should go to the trouble of opening the tomb.
