    sight: >
      This small annex with its plain walls is disappointing. From the imprints left in the dust covering the
      floor, you believe that several items had once been stored here. Yet according to legend, the greatest
      treasures are stored in a magically sealed chamber that will only be accessible upon Neferteri's final
      death.
