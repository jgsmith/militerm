      Stacked in this room are many wondrous things. Strange carvings of animals, statues, boxes, everything
      it would appear to aid the king and queen through their journey through the afterlife. Closer inspection
      reveals caskets of mummified cats and birds, obviously the beloved pets of the royal couple. Searching
      through the jumble of objects, you realize anything of significant value has already been plundered by
      tomb robbers.
