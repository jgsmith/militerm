    sight: >
      The walls of this long hall are also filled with bright colorful paintings depicting the rites of
      worship to the gods. Your excitement grows as you see several pictures of a falcon, rumored to be the
      chosen symbol of the high priestess Neferteri. Visions of the treasure she reportedly stole from the
      people dance in your head urging you to explore and move deeper into the pyramid. Again you wonder if
      the &+mhieroglyphs&N on the wall hold the secret to defeating Neferteri and the way to obtaining her
      treasure.
