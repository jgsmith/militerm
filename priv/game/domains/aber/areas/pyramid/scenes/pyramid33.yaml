      &+YGold&N! The glint of it is everywhere as you gaze around the room. The walls have been &+Yglided&N
      and scenes carved into them displaying Neferteri and her journey to glory and infamy. &+YGolden&N
      statues bearing the likeness of the high priestess sit upon bound chests far too large for one person to
      carry. The seal on one chest has been broken, the lid tossed back revealing the wealth inside of it. Yet
      something makes you pause before scooping up the vast treasures that seem yours for the taking.
