      &+WLight&N pours in from two long slitted windows at the sides of the tip of this pyramid. Unlike the
      rest of the pyramid, not a trace of dust can be found on the floor. You can hear the sighing of the hot
      desert wind as it rustles around the top of this magnificent tomb. The room is dominated by a tall
      figure with the body of a man and the head of a falcon. Large rounded eyes carefully observe you, making
      you shudder and wonder if this creature can peer into your very soul. You believe you have finally found
      Horus, son of Isis and Osiris, the fierce guardian of Neferteri's vast power.
