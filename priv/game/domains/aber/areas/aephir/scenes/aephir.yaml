    short: In The Shade Of The Platinum Tree
    sight: >
      You are standing in a gigantic clearing, teeming with life. The grass here tickles your ankles, and in
      the center of the clearing is a strange tree. The tree which, by some magic has been transformed to the
      color of platinum seems to reach to the sky. The tree casts a huge shadow over you as you stand among
      the dark green grass. A &+Bthrone&* seems to have grown out of the center of the tree's immense trunk.
