    sight: >
      You are standing among a forest teeming with life. You feel cool breezes around you, and hear the rustle
      of leaves. High in the tall oak and maple trees you can hear the enchanting songs of birds. Below the
      canopy of trees are fern plants and short dark green grass. You feel the strong urge to simply wander
      about and follow the songs of the birds above.
