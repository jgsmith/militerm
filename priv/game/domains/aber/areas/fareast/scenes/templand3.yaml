    short: Snowy Peak
    sight: >
      The highest point in this part of the mountains flattens out to form a mesa, covered in a thin blanket
      of powdery snow. The snow does not reach any lower, but seems to stay contained on this level. Steep
      slopes lead down into the crags and cliffs below, either to the south or west. To the east, a short walk
      would take you to the terraced temple that fills the horizon. Snow clings to its eaves, and piles in
      drifts before its open doors.
