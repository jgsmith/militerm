    short: Cliffside Pass
    sight: >
      This pass is cold and windswept, due to the breeze coming from the peaks high above. This wind whistles
      in a crack in the rock face to your south, a gap wide enough to squeeze through. A narrow gap in the
      eastern rockface allows you to ascend from here. Below, a broad plateau stretches off to the west,
      toward a chasm spanned by a narrow rope bridge. The pass continues on toward the north, rising more
      gradually toward a cavern mouth.
