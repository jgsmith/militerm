    sight: >
      "Crossroads" is perhaps not the right name for this area: two roads do not so much meet here as crash
      together. The surfaces are buckled and broken, and the stone surface of the east-west road dives
      underneath and then crashes through its north-south counterpart. Bits of the paving stones lie on either
      side of the crossing, scattered like gravel. To the west, a dark haze obscures your vision, and to the
      east, a grey fog blows toward you as if to feed it. The southern path seems to be snapped off before it
      reaches very far, and only the northern path, which terminates in a forest of blossoming cherry trees,
      seems to offer any desirable goal.
