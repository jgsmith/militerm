    sight: >
      This ridge overlooks a stream descending from further on up the northwest valley, and you can make out a
      rice paddy and groups of peasants downstream to the south. A well-worn path cuts up the side of the rise
      to the north, following the valley closely while continuing to climb. To the west, a sloping descent
      will bring you down and over to a slightly lower spot on the same northern cliff face.
