      The road is strewn with gravel and small pebbles, which thicken toward the north until the path is
      completely obscured. Larger and larger piles of stone end at a high rockface, split by a narrow crack.
      Toward the south, the gravelly soil clears enough that it has been cultivated. The road in that
      direction is crossed by an east-west path, forming a crossroads.
