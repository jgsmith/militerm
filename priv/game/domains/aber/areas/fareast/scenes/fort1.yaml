      No battle plans are drawn up in the War Room, no maps with clay or bronze figurines marking the
      placement of troops: there was no preparation for the battle that lost this fortress. No opposing army
      swept over the southern plains. The only strategic element in this room, in fact, seems to be a large Go
      board, standing in a quiet corner.
