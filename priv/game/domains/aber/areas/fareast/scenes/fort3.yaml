      This vast dining hall was designed to feed the daimyo's troops, as well as to prepare the meals for that
      ruler and his family. Now, it stands silent, the low tables smashed and the seat-cushions torn apart. A
      pile of discarded sacks, husks, and other trash stands in the midst of the destruction, like the
      remnants of a huge midnight snack.
