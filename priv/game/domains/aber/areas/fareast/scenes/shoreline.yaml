      The waves roll up onto the stony beach to the east, bringing new waters back from a freshwater outlet as
      they recede. Weathered cliffs obscure the area further inland, but you can see a gap in them where the
      stream's erosion has broken through. The beach stretches on to your north and south, and the choppy sea
      stretches to the western horizon.
