    short: Eno Courtyard
    sight: >
      Just behind the walls of Eno is the only clear spot in the city: A large courtyard flanked by statues
      and landscaping. Koi float belly-up in small pools, and once-beautiful stone gardens have been raked
      across by claws rather than garden tools. A stench of sulfur hangs in the air, which seems to darken as
      you near the center of the city, the daimyo's fortress to the north. To the west, a guardhouse has been
      erected along the wall. To the east, the remains of the city's homes lie in long-dead ashes. The city
      walls are in the opposite direction- south- and the barred gate looks impassable from this side. The
      high earthen walls are too smooth to climb without aid.
