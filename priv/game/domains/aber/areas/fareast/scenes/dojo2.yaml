    sight: >
      The northern hall of this dojo has been filled with straw pallets, and converted into sleeping quarters.
      Students had no need for worldly posessions or comfort, and so their bedding was the necessary minimum.
      Black tar oozes from the splintered floor, soaking into the matresses.
