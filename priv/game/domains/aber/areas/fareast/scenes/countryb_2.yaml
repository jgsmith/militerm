    sight: >
      The road is broken into chunks here, and partially scattered across the dark and festering plains. A
      greyish pall overhead blows from the west to the east, toward a darker cloud... and not a cloud of water
      vapor. To the south, the road drops away suddenly, to the north, it joins another at a crossroads.
