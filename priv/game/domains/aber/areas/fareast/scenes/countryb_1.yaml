    short: Countryside- Gnarled Scrub
    sight: >
      The scrub brush and vegetation that overgrows this area of countryside is twisted and stunted, as if the
      soil were poisoned. Only small clumps of grass remain, though the earth is dark and seemingly fertile.
      Looking south, this blight seems to get worse, and a pall hangs over the sky in that direction. Back to
      the north, the road meets another, and the land gives way to cultivated farmlands, albeit in rocky soil.
