    sight: >
      At the top of a stone staircase, this road speaks of a fairly advanced civilization nearby. Shaped
      stones have been set in a spiralling pattern, leading far off to the north. The staircase leads down the
      cliffs to the southwest, where you can hear surf hitting the rocky beach.
