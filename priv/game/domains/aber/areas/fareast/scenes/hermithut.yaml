    short: Dilapidated Hut
    sight: >
      This hut is a framework of bamboo poles covered with insulating moss, an adequate protection against the
      biting wind. Not many personal effects mark it as inhabited, but there is a fire ring near the center of
      the floor, filled with charcoal, and a few cooking implements have been set out beside it.
