    short: Fortress- Upper Level
    sight: >
      The upper hall of the fortress has been the site of many battle plans, but never before has conflict
      reached such a secure spot. Now, however, the bodies of many loyal samurai lie atop each other, slain by
      an enemy powerful enough to breach that security and occupy the fortress itself. A staircase leads back
      down to the fortress' lower floors, and three pairs of double doors stand to the north, east, and south.
