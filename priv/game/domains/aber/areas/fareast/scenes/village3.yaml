    short: Peasant Village-Eastern Entrance
    sight: >
      The eastern entrance to this tiny village has a barely servicable arch marking the spot where the
      buildings end and the countryside begins, or vice versa. Indeed, off to the east, the country stretches
      without interruption, while to the west, a cluster of wooden huts and storage sheds comprises the home
      of the low-caste.
