    sight: >
      The City of Eno rises high above you to the immediate north. However, a massive gate stands between
      there and here, and a padlock of proportionate size is on its door. High earthen walls wrap around to
      the east and west, and their smooth sides would make climbing impossible without help. A road leading
      from the gates reaches off toward the south, to a grove of trees far in the distance, and a narrow dirt
      path leads off to the east.
