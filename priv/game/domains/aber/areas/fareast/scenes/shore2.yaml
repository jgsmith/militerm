    sight: >
      The cliffs that divide this beach from the main expanse of the island wrap around to cut the shoreline
      short. A nearly vertical wall, stretching out into the water and continuing south, blocks any travel in
      that direction. Steps have been cut into the face to the east, however, and should make ascent easy.
      Down the beach, to the west, stands the sea, and a ship rests in harbor to the northwest. The beach
      continues to the north.
