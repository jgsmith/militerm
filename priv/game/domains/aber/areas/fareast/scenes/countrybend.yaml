      The road ends abruptly here... since there is no land for it to cross. You stand on the edge of a
      abyssal gap, the sod and rock torn away from the edge as if scraped out by a titan's foot. Rocks
      dislodged from the edge tumble for nearly half a minute before hitting the bottom, and you would
      undoubtedly suffer the same freefall and landing if you were to continue on.
