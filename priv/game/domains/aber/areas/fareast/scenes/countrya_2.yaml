    sight: >
      Scrub brush and tall grasses choke the land around this stretch of road. To the north, this verdure
      fades into carefully kept fields and pastures. The overgrowth gradually thickens toward the south, but a
      line of haze and dead foliage marks where the green abruptly changes to black, and the healthy
      overgrowth changes to sickly clots of blighted vegetation and intertwining brambles. Just before that
      line, the roadside drops away toward a sinkhole, the bottom of which looks clean and bare.
