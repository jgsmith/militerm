    sight: >
      The beach is broken here by the outpouring waters of a freshwater stream, forcing its way down to the
      ocean. Standing on the rocks at its edge, you can see a gap in the cliff wall, undoubtedly cut by the
      stream in its youth. This leads to an eastern valley between the cliffs, while the beach reaches
      underneath this facade to the north and south. To the west, the outlet has formed a small harbor, where
      a ship bobs in the choppy waves.
