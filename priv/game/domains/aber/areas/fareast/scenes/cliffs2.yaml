    sight: >
      The top of the cliffs is flat and broad, and offers a very good view of the shoreline to the west, as
      well as the drop-off to the south, where a stream has cut through the stone, forming a wide valley. A
      narrowing rise leads towards the east, deeper into the cliffs and further up. Travelling north, however,
      will only take you to a small overhang, and from there the only way is down or back.
