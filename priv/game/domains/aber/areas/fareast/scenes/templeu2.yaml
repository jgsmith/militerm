    sight: >
      The temple's altar is brightly lit, filled from wall to wall with elaborate candelabras filled with
      candles of every size, color, and type. The flickering lights illuminate brightly colored rugs on the
      floor and elaborate paintings on the ceiling and walls. A wooden staircase in the far corner leads back
      down into the ground floor.
