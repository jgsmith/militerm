    sight: >
      This section of the upper level is open on two sides- to the south to allow passage back and forth
      between the two platforms, and to the north, only a small window-slit is left open. A post outside
      offers some clue as to the purpose: small indentations in the wood indicate some sort of impact. A
      practice course for some skill, perhaps.
