    sight: >
      The gradual rise here is abutted to the east by a steep face, which is rough enough to scale to the
      temple above. To the north, a small hut of bamboo and moss is wedged into a crack in the blocking stone
      wall. Down the slope, an easy walk to the south, a narrow gap opens onto the cliffside below.
