    sight: >
      The western entrance to the village is nothing more than a couple of large buildings for storing rice
      and fish from the nearby stream. Further to the east are the small wooden huts that house the
      inhabitants, who seem intent on avoiding you. Many of them disappear down the hill to the west, heading
      toward the rice paddy. One of the storehouses is open and unguarded to the south.
