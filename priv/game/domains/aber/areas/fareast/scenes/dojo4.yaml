    sight: >
      Empty hooks, pegs, and rings wait for weapons that will never be hung here again. Wooden forms for armor
      stand like bare skeletons. This room once held enough weaponry for a small army, but now only a few
      pieces remain. Either scavengers or the retreating students have taken everything of value.
