    short: Cherry Orchard- Western Entrance
    sight: >
      The road here passes from the open countryside to the west to a tangled "orchard" of cherry trees to the
      east. The road passes directly under the boughs, and is covered with falling petals. A small path leads
      north from this spot, toward another grove of blossoming trees, possibly apple or pear. These orchards
      are the pride of Eno, and stretch on for many miles.
