    sight: >
      The bridge sways alarmingly as you stand at its center. It reaches from east to west, with a small
      plateau supporting either end. Looking down, the stream is visible, constrained by the narrow pass and
      foaming over rapids. Someone crossing this bridge could easily lose their footing and tumble to the
      water below.
