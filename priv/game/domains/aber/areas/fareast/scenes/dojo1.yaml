    sight: >
      The everpresent gas seeps into this hallway through rips and tears in the paper walls. Sliding doors in
      all major directions do little to hide the contents of this building's other rooms. From the general
      layout, this would be a dojo, a training hall. To the north are the sleeping quarters, to the south, a
      training facility, an armory of sorts lies to the west, and the eastern portal is open to the "air." A
      rickety ladder also leads upward onto wooden platforms above.
