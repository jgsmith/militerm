    sight: >
      There's not much to see or do here, the wooden buildings have burned totally to the ground and the stone
      structures have been torn apart. Here and there, you can see lighter patches which often turn out to be
      bones or broken marble statues, but mostly the landscape is an even, sooty black. The roads are all
      clogged except for the path back to the west.
