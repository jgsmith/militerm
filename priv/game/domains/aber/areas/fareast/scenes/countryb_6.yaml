    sight: >
      Two dirt paths, diverging from two main roads higher uphill, meet here in a clearing. It is swept free
      of the gravel and sediment that cover most of the surrounding lands; a stiffly cold wind blasts across
      it toward the west, attempting to clear the sky of clinging haze and fog.
