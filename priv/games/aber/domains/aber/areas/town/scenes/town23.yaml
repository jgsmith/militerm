    sight: >
      There are many weapons on display here, with bows and very fancy swords on display at the back of the
      room. Malicious weapons are locked to the walls to keep prying hands away from the wares. To the north
      you see that you may enter a small room of the weapons shop, or you may go south to the Town square.
