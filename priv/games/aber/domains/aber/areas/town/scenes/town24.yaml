    short: Square Near Weapons Shop
    sight: >
      This is just a small part of the large town square. This part of the square is located near the Main
      Weapons shop, so there seems to be many weapon dealers in the area, trying to sell their wares to unwary
      adventurers. There are exits in all directions, to the north is the Main Weapons shop, to the east is
      the Grocer's store, to the south is the Main Square in town, and to the west is the small square near
      the Blacksmith's shop.
