    sight: >
      From this point you can see all around the lands of Pensalon. Off in the distance you can see a small
      commerce town, and you can even see the mighty Castle of the King of Pensalon where the Elemental Wizard
      resides and works his mighty magic. Towards the East you can see a small man wearing a hard hat and
      wielding mighty magics and shaping the land itself. As you come back to your senses you notice that you
      are standing in a small campsite with a little signal fire burning merrily. You can climb back down the
      cliff or go explore the cave to the north.
