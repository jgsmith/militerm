    sight: >
      The river narrows a little here, still allowing large sea-faring vessels to enter the bay to the west.
      The water flows gently toward the entrance of the inlet, mixing the salt water with the fresh water from
      the bay. To the east the endless void of the sea can still be seen and the memory of the long sea voyage
      is still fresh in your mind.
