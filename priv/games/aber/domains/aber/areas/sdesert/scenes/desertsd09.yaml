    short: Another Split In The Path
    sight: >
      The path splits here, one part leading off to the &+yeast&* and the other continuing to the &+ysouth&*.
      Scanning the horizon, you see nothing but dry, dull, weeds, and the occasional stately Saguaro cactus.
      You wonder how the world got to be so darn ugly.
