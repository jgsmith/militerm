    short: The Beginning Of The Southern Desert
    sight: >
      This path marks the beginning of the long road to the southern part of the world. There are several
      rumors as to where it leads, but no one knows for sure. Looking &+gsouth&*, you gaze into a panorama of
      a rocky, cactus-dotted land, shimmering in the heat of the day.
