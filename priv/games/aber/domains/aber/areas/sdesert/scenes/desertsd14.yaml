    sight: >
      Here you stop, and gaze of into the panoramic view to the &+Ceast. The path here has ceased to exist,
      due to the severe drop down to the rest of the desert far below you. Off in the distance you see a huge
      landmark, that looks strikingly similar to an enormous crater.
