    sight: >
      You are on a gentle rocky slope just south of the elven forest. A small brook runs by here, dropping
      down among the boulders and shrubs that adorn the landscape. It flows east into the valley, and you can
      cross it if you wish. Alternatively you could head south over a small rocky lip and into a damp and
      rather depressing peat bog.
