    short: Peat Bog
    sight: >
      You are sinking up to your knees in peaty water, cunningly disguised as firm ground - a layer of mud
      over the surface of the water gives the illusion of solidity. All around you are small moss-covered
      tussocks, surrounded by pools of water or thick layers of sphagnum. Sundews and butterworts thrive in
      this damp environment, and little horsetails grow in clumps in the drier spots. To the south is a small
      lochan, brown with peat, which gains its colour from the water draining into it from this bog.
