    sight: >
      You are on the lower slopes of Ben Mor, a smallish mountain which rises to the west. The ground here is
      uneven but rich enough to support a number of large douglas firs which tower up to two hundred feet into
      the sky. A deep cleft in the mountainside to the north bars your route in that direction.
