    sight: >
      This is, or was, an old cottage belonging to a crofter who has long since moved on or died. Daylight
      shows through holes in the roof and the stone walls utterly fail to keep out the cold. The furniture in
      here is spartan to say the least, and you marvel at the hardiness of those who could permanently live in
      such conditions.
