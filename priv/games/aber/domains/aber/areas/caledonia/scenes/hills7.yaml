    sight: >
      You are wandering about amongst the ruins of an old castle. One solitary tower remains standing, as well
      as much of the outer wall, but you discount immediately any thought of an ascent - the crumbling stone
      looks as if it may collapse at any time. Once, though, you can imagine, this was probably an impressive
      place, though somewhat vulnerable to assault. Perhaps that is why it now lies in ruins.
