    sight: >
      You are standing by the side of a chilly lochan, whose waters are dark brown with peat washed into it
      from the surrounding slopes. The surface is still but every so often you see a splash far out in the
      middle of the lochan. Something is alive in the murk. To the east, on the top of a grassy hillock, is an
      ancient and very much ruined castle.
