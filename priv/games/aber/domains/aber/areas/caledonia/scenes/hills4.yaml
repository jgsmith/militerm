    short: Edge Of Pine Forest
    sight: >
      You are at the northern edge of a little pine forest which shelters beneath the dark hulking massif to
      the south. Some of the evergreen branches are bent under the weight of days-old snow which has not yet
      melted by virtue of having seldom seen the sun, lying as they do for most of the day in the shadow of
      the mountains.
