    sight: >
      You are on the back of Ben Mor, a modest-sized mountain with a heather-clad summit which lies to the
      east. The climb to the peak is not difficult and the exercise would no doubt do you a lot of good.
      However an easier way lies to the west, where a long path along the base of the mountains comes to a
      fork.
