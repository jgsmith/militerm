    short: Summit Of Ben Mor
    sight: >
      You are on the highest point of the peak known as Ben Mor. Your view over the flatlands to the west is
      unimpeded and you can see all the way to the infamous Castle Hohenzollern, somewhat hazy and ill-defined
      in the distance. To the north, halfway down the mountain, is a small cottage in which you could perhaps
      shelter from the cold wind that chills your bones as you stand here.
