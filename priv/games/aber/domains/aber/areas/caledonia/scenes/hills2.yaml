    short: Cattle Trail
    sight: >
      You are following a much-used cattle trail which leads through the tall mountains around you. You tread
      carefully to avoid the hefty deposits left by the cattle, which are still fairly fresh. To the
      north-west is a small lake, nestling among the peaks which surround it. You can go in any direction.
