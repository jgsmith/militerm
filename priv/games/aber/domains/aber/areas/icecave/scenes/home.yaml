    sight: >
      Welcome to Iceman's private cubicle. Despite the icy surroundings, you feel warm and safe here. Some of
      the Iceman's robes are hanging in a closet, along with some impressive weapons you dare not touch. On
      his desk you see some scrolls covered with Nordic runes, and an unfinished supper, indicating the Iceman
      has only stepped out for a moment. You notice several copies of "Teach Yourself Swedish" in the
      bookcase, but one seems to be missing. A portrait of his beautiful wife, Lady Galadriel, adorns the
      otherwise bare walls. A single exit leads south.
