    sight: >
      You stand in awe in a vast cave dominated by a crystal pool. The surface of the water is a perfect
      mirror, casting silvery reflections on the walls. Magic fills the air, and in the water there are
      manatees and manatoos. Dewdrops glisten on the rocks and edelweiss grow in the most unlikely places,
      among stones and unfinished ice sculptures.
