    short: Hall Of The Ice People
    sight: >
      This is the great Hall Of The Ice People. This is where they come to eat, to drink, and to be merry.
      Carvings on the walls tell fascinating sagas of the giant Thrym and Mjolnir, of the ship Skidbladnir and
      Ragnarok, and of the One Tree, Yggdrasil. The hall is deserted now, and you wonder where everyone is
      hiding. There is some sort of door in the northern wall.
