    short: The Cave of the Ice People
    sight: >
      You are standing in a vast icy cave. Ice covers the floor, making your balance precarious at best.
      Judging from the footprints, however, it seems others have been here before you and safely traversed
      this slippery surface. A message carved into one wall reads "We Always Bit Chips." Passages lead in all
      directions.
