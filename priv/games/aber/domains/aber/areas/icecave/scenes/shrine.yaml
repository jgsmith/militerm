    short: The Lost Shrine of the Ice People
    sight: >
      A cobweb brushes across your face. From the abundace of them here, it would seem that this room does not
      see much use. Though the dimness of the light does not allow you to be sure, the groaning of the ceiling
      causes you to move quietly, as you would rather not have the tons of mountain above you fall in. Closer
      inspection of the walls reveals ancient, intricate images of huge glaciers and a figure you can only
      guess to be the god of the Ice People, who they venerate here.
