    sight: >
      You find yourself walking in a well lit tunnel with ice covered walls, ceiling, and floor. In addition
      to the frozen footprints of the Ice People you also make out some hoofprints. The tunnel continues to
      the south. An exit to the north leads to the relative safety of a great hall.
