      The wind glides through the trees at this height, brushing the remaining gray leaves and gently swaying
      the branches. Far below and around you lies the thick jungle, and you can also see the top of a large
      waterfall with a village and temple nearby. Some tropical birds fly overhead, and their screeching
      leader orders the fine-feathered formation occupy the upper parts of the great tree.
