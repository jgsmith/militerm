      This is the main production and shipping room, where crates, bags, boxes, and barrels stand in severe
      stacks, ready to move to their destinations. Most of the equipment here is to be sent northward to fight
      in the king's war. A manually-cranked conveyor belt and a full staff comprise the assembly line. Stone
      stairs lead upward while the exit to the outside world is west.
