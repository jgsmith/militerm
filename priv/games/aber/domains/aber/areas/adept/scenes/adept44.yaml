    sight: >
      The branches here decide to visit the ground and force travelers to kneel and crawl their way through
      the dense forest. Clusters of branches join ranks in many spots, seeking an eye to pop. To the east and
      west are clearer areas of forest matter, while the north holds a genuine wall of wood.
