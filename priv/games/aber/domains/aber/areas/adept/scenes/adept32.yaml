    sight: >
      A mighty fortress looms before you, surrounded by fifty foot walls and the open, grassy plain. Only one
      entrance is visible - the portcullis. Guards stand on both sides of the massive gate and watch patiently
      as carts travel in and out, no doubt keeping some level of suspicion on each soul. Whenever an
      official-looking dignitary attempts to pass, the guards cross their spears and demand to see
      authorization papers. The activity here is consistent with that of being nearby a war zone, as many of
      the land's arms merchants are making huge profits selling their wares.
