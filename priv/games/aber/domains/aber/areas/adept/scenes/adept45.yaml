    short: Wall of Roots
    sight: >
      A thick mass of roots here blocks all normal travel except to the south, but there is a dark, uninviting
      hole to the east. Foul fumes from rotting and diseased bodies emanate from it, and the side of the pit
      is marked by an intensely green, spiked mushroom. A collection of the roots move down from high above
      and flow together, entwining to form a knob at about two feet above the ground.
