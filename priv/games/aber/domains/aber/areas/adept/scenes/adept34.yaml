      Perhaps during peacetime this place would be sanctimonious. Today, the king is pressured with the latest
      reports from the battlefields northeast of the castle grounds and developing crises on other fronts. The
      council of advisors and highest military officers ar heavily debating plans of attack and the possible
      outcomes, while kitchen scullies attempt to plcate the appetites such discussion has worked up. Waiting
      in the background are the serving ladies who wonder which of the officers or advisors they will be
      enjoying the night with.
