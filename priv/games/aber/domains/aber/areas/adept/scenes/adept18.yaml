      All kinds of armor, shields, and helmets line the walls on shelves and racks. On a stand off to one side
      is a suit of silver mithrail - a rare form of magical armor. A bronze shield lays at the base of the
      counter, and a battered and dented helm badly in need of repair or scrapping has been tossed onto a pile
      of broken equipment.
