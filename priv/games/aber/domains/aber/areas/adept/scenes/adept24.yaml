      This small chamber has jars of contaminated cleaning solutions covered in dust and spiderwebs. A coat
      rack on the back wall seems nearly entirely eaten away by mold, while the metal fittings on the pipes
      leading around the room have all but rusted away. A check-out list on a hook by the door shows this room
      last used over 10 years ago, when the caretaker of the building was mauled to death by a local grizzly.
      The people of Whisper City never bothered to replace the poor old fool, so this place was left to rot
      away in time.
