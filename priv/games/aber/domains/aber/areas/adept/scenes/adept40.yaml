      Well, here's where all the rainwater and scum of the land collect to celebrate the rest of their natural
      lives in solitary confinement. Shackles for legs and manacles for arms are connected by a lynchpin, from
      which a 500 pound cannon ball has been attached. For all those given an execution sentence, an iron
      maiden is conveniently located near the east wall, complete with a basket for catching the body's organs
      as they fall out.
