      A beautiful field of multi-colored weeds and small plants decorate this plain for miles. Only a few
      trees from the Nareth ever made it this far to the ocean, the sea breezes having eroded away the
      minerals of life from the grainy soil. However, the wind doesn't bother the insects who feed on the
      weeds here in great quantities. Their bodies also rejuvenate the ground to make the vegetation even more
      healthy in years to come.
