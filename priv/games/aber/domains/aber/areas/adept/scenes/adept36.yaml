      Some mad scientist's dream lab is in this room! On tables randomly spread about the chamber are many
      kinds of glass equipment connected to each other via corks and rubber tubing. Small flames heat a green
      liquid in one corner, transforming it into a pale gas, which flows through the entire apparatus and
      settles into a gigantic flask bolted to the floor.
