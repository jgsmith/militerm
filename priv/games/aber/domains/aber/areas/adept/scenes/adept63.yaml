    sight: >
      Junior officers are the main inhabitants of this room when on duty. They generally have the keenest
      senses of sight among the crew, watching patiently and intently for land, storms, serpents, and other
      ships. There are many pairs of viewing glasses strapped to the walls to help better the visual range.
      Maps on a nearby table and a gyroscope in the corner serve to help plot the ship's course, and an
      ancient sextant is rigged to give the Seeker's current coordinates at any given time.
