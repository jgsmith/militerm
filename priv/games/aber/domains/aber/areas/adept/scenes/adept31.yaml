    short: Forest Path
    sight: >
      This heavily wooded path leads through many twists and turns as it meanders along. The dense underbrush
      snaps and crackles with each echoing footstep, scaring away all kinds of ground-dwelling critters. To
      the north, the forest open onto grasslands.
