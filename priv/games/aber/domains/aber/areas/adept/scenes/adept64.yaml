      This medium-sized room was made with respect. Although not overly furnished and adorned with golden
      ropes, the captain's room serves to remind the crew that the captain is in charge. A small desk and an
      even smaller barrel are the main items of furniture. The &+Cbed&* is just big enough to hold the
      captain.
