    short: Trunk by Lowest Branch
    sight: >
      You have reached the bottom branch of the tree, which extends off to the south. A section of mottled
      yellow shelf fungus grows here, the largest one you've ever seen. It looks like it could easily support
      your weight. The shelf circles the tree to the west. You think you hear the chattering of monkeys coming
      from further out on the branch. Above you, more branches sprout from the tree, and the greenery gets
      thicker.
