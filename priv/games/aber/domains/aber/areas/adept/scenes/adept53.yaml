    short: Glen of the Ancients
    sight: >
      This is one of the oldest sections of the Nareth Forest and has been preserved because of its history.
      Almost a thousand years since they were first planted, the hybrid hemlock-sequoia trees grow nearly 400
      feet high in loose formation. They were blessed by many a priest and even the ArchMage Adept himself to
      keep them prosperous for as many generations as possible, sort of a challenge to the clergy's abilities
      to influence nature. Despite the tender care that went into making this glen possible, the trees have
      not escaped time unscathed. The glen was often spoken of in lore classes for those in the magic initiate
      classes, and many a mischievous couple have spent days within the isolation of the trees, whispering
      sweet words of love to each other and lightly carving their initials into the bark.
