      The heat is sweltering within these stony walls. A large bucket of water is beside the door; a hundred
      different-sized blades cooling in it even as the water boils and turns to steam. An anvil is on a stone
      pedestal in the middle of the room, clanging loudly as each blow of the blacksmith's hammer pounds
      another dent in the steel of yet another sword or axe. On the wall beyond the anvil is a large wooden
      workbench. Detailed plans of war machine construction and wall fortifications and the latest requests
      for weaponry and armor cover the table surface. Hanging above the table are the tools of the trade -
      several lengths of files, strong-grip tongs, temperment clay, hammers, and spikes. Hanging about the
      room are works in progress.
