    sight: >
      The vine top is the formation of a huge cradle supporting the reproductive organs of the vine. The smell
      of carbolic acid is still in the air as the plant produces more of it to sustain its internal transport
      system. Close to the center of the cradle rests a flatop mound of plant flesh.
