      The room is massively huge and must have taken a year to completely dig out. Large numbers of flying
      insects hover near the roof and illuminate the chamber, revealing a dais in the middle of the room. A
      mess of bottles and powedered ingredients lie cluttered on it and on the floor. Large bookcases dominate
      each corner, their tomes covered in the letterings of a language unspoken for thousands of years. The
      floor is kept free of dust, mold, and bugs by a heavy web of enchantments. There are two conflicting
      auras in the room - one good and the other confusion - which feed the power of the network of spells
      placed on the room.
