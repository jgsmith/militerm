    short: Nareth Forest
    sight: >
      The welcoming green of millions of leaves on thousands of trees of various colors of brown and tan
      flourishes before your eyes. Mainly a deciduous, low-latitude area, the Nareth supports species of life
      rivalling that of the rain forests. Those who were the first ones here were kind enough to trailblaze
      carefully to preserve the ecology. As it is, the sounds of life are never far. Low trees and bushes
      shake at random as the chase of the food chain is brought to them; an army of crickets burst forth from
      up the path with a red fox in hot pursuit. A garden snake slithers around your feet and disappears into
      the safety of its burrow. Besides the animal habitation sounds, the wind is doing its own fair share of
      whistling as it skims the tops of the trees.
