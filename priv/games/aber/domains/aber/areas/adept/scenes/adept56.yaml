    sight: >
      A sheer, vertical wall of reddish-brown rock blocks all passage except to the south. The mesa appears to
      be over 2000 feet above the forest floor and should provide excellent scouting terrain. The trees stop
      abruptly at the base of the wall, where there is a staircase winding up and around the mesa.
