      This appears to be a former two-room house, the back bedroom entrance now completely blocked by the
      roots of a great tree. Old and cracked furniture in the final stages of rotting is strewn throughout the
      room, suggesting a major last stand by the occupants occurred here. A broken clock still hanging by a
      decaying wooden hook is forever stopped at 8pm. The clutter in the room is such that the whole place
      should be burned.
