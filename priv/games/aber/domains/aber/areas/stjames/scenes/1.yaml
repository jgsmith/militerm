    short: Entrance to St. James Park
    sight: >
      You are standing at the entrance to St. James Park. Set in the middle of London, very close to
      Westminster Abbey, the park is a refreshing change from the dirt and bustle of the city itself. The park
      stretches out to the west and consists of many green lawns, a pond spanned by a single bridge, and two
      stone paths; one on either side of the pond. To the north is the pond, to the south are the green lawns,
      and way ahead to the west you can just make out the back wings of Buckingham Palace. Outside the park to
      the south is the Abbey.
