    short: The Edge of the Pond
    sight: >
      Standing on the edge of the pond, the glorious fountain is straight ahead of you. The water it tosses
      into the air is clean and clear and looks very refreshing on this hot day. The grass you are standing on
      is perfectly manicured. To the northwest is a small island in the water. It looks as though there are a
      few boats lying around on the shore that you could take if you felt like canoeing.
