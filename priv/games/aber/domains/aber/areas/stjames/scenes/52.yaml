    short: On the Pond
    sight: >
      Here the pond ends, near the gardens of Buckingham Palace. You can go no further to the west. The entire
      park is now to the east. All you can see is green on either side of the pond. Ahead the bridge rises
      above the water, and you can see a bit of the island underneath it.
