    short: Path Through St. James Park
    sight: >
      You are on the northern east-west path through St. James Park. To the east is the northern park
      entrance, and to the west is the expanse of the park. The park meets Buckingham Palace to the west. To
      the south is a pond with a large fountain in it. Beyond the pond is a grassy place specked with trees
      and people. The path is lined on both sides by green park benches.
