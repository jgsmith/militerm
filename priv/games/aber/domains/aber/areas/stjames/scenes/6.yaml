    sight: >
      You are north of the northern path through St. James Park. To the south you see a pond, beyond which
      lies a large expanse of beautiful green grass. The park is a welcome change to the hustle and bustle of
      the city. The lawns are well-manicured and the pond looks cool and clear.
