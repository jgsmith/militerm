      Traveling along the northern edge of the park, you study the people walking on the street. They are all
      headed toward the palace, and most of them are holding cameras and other objects which mark them as
      tourists. You hear many languages among the group. It seems that a good portion of the world is in
      London for the V-E Day Celebrations.
