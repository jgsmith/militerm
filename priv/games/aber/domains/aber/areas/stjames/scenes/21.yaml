    sight: >
      You are along the northern area of the park. To the north of here is a large street which goes to
      Buckingham Palace. There are many people walking along the street, and you notice that, in contrast to
      the rest of the city, no one walking there is in any hurry. To the south is a beautiful pond with a
      fountain in it. There is a bridge over the pond. The whole park is very beautiful and serves as a
      relaxing change from the city.
