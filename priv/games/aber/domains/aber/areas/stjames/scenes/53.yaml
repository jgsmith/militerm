    sight: >
      You are up against the western wall of the park. It seems to be several feet thick. At the top of the
      wall are rotating 6-inch spikes, each at an angle to the one next to it. To climb over the wall, one
      would have to have a lot of faith in one's flexibility. Perhaps it is best if you leave the Queen alone.
