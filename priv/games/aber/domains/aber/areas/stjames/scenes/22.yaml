    sight: >
      You are on the northern east-west path through the park. To the south of the pond you can make out
      another path, accessible via a bridge that spans the middle of the pond just off to the southwest. To
      the west is Buckingham Palace, while to the east is the park entrance with the city beyond. On the south
      side of the pond is a large grassy area.
