    short: On the Pond
    sight: >
      You are floating just to the west of the bridge over the pond. The island is just to the eastern side of
      the bridge, with the fountain slightly beyond it. Beyond them both is a well-populated wading area. The
      water is smooth and clean. The pond itself ends to the west at the Palace wall.
