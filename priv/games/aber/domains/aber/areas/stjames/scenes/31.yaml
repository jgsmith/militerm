    sight: >
      You are in the middle of the bridge which spans the pond. The water below is clean and clear. There are
      people talking under the trees to the south, and some people on benches to the north. One person is
      canoeing toward the pond's small island in the pond. To the west is a great photo opportunity of
      Buckingham Palace.
