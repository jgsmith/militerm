    short: Path Through St. James Park
    sight: >
      You are on the main east-west path through St. James Park. To the northwest is a bridge which spans the
      pond. To the west is Buckingham Palace, while to the east is the main park entrance with the city
      beyond. To the south is a large grassy space. The fountain is very close to you now, spitting its water
      into the air with impeccable grace.
