    sight: >
      The pond that dominates the park meets with the lawn upon which you are standing, just to the west. It
      looks as if the section of the pond nearest you has been marked off for wading. Perhaps it would feel
      good to dangle your feet in the cool water for a little while. From where you stand, you notice that
      there is a second path through the park just to the north of the pond.
