    short: Pathway Through St. James Park
    sight: >
      You are on an east-west path through St. James Park. To the east is the park entrance, and to the west
      is the expanse of the park. The park ends to the west where it joins with the gardens of Buckingham
      Palace. To the north is a pond with a large fountain in it, and to the south is a huge grassy place
      speckled with trees and people. The path is lined on both sides by green park benches.
