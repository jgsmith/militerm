      You are standing on the temple steps. Enormous and made out of single slabs of stone, they represent the
      work of the proud civilization of a bygone era. Before you looms the mouth of the temple, and from it a
      curious smell is issuing. It mingles with the heady odour of the rotting plants to the south, arousing
      conflicting thoughts within you. You are much too confused to puzzle them out though.
