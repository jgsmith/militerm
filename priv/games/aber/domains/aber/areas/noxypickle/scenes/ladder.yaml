    short: Stone-Carved Ladder
    sight: >
      You are clinging to a ladder carved into the rock, about midway between the top and the bottom. A dim
      light comes from above you, but below you all is pitch black. The vertical tunnel you are in is barely
      wide enough to allow you passage, and the cramped conditions are making you feel somewhat
      claustrophobic.
