    short: Sea of Holes
    sight: >
      You are drifting in a sea of psychedelic holes. In the water (?) below, you can just barely make out
      several blue gloves and clowns chasing each other and bickering. On the top of an undersea mountain,
      sits a purple fractal dragon, observing the ruckess while puffing on his purple hooka and sniffing
      flowers. Exits are everywhere.
