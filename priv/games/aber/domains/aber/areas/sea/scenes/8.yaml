    sight: >
      You are out all at sea, lost amidst the seething waves and grey skies, a speck on an undulating dark
      mass. The seas are heavy all around you, though not too rough to the west. To the south the waves smooth
      off quite a bit, providing you can cross the rough waters before it.
