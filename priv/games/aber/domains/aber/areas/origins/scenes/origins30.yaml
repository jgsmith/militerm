    sight: >
      You reach the main gates of the castle. Looking up, you see the tops of the towers reach high into the
      mist, like black spires twisting their way through your flesh. The gates themselves seem deadly --
      totally blackened and misshapen. You can continue on through the open threshold (there might have once
      been a door here), or you can wisely return north towards Willowdale.
