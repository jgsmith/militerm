    sight: >
      The twisted road becomes more and more narrow here, and moving is increasingly difficult. The air is
      thicker still, and the comforting rays of the sun are not to be found. To the south is a slightly more
      comforting environment, and you dread to walk further north, into the empty dreariness.
