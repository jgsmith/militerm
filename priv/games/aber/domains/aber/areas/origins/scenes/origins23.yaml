    short: The Forest Shadow
    sight: >
      You enter perhaps the most tortured and vile woods you ever seen. You can see the trees literally
      weeping blood, and not even one bird can be found. The forest gets too thick to negotiate any further.
      Your one option is to return south whence you came.
