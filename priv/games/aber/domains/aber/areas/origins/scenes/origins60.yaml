    short: The City of Immortals
    sight: >
      After many an hour of tiresome marching, you come upon a large, beautiful city. The road is indeed
      marble white, and the buildings are purest gold. The mountain is closer than ever now, and its peak is
      hidden in wispy, fluffy, white clouds. But what distracts your attention from all this beauty is the
      scores upon scores of dead bodies of all races, which line the road and the rest of the City. You may
      now turn left, to an area of the City marked as 'Apollo's Hemisphere', turn right to another division
      marked 'Dionysus's Hemisphere,' or continue north to the base of the great mountain.
