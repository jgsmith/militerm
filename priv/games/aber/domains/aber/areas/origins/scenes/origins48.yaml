    sight: >
      You come to a large compound, almost as large as the Temple of Syrinx, filled with large objects that
      fly without effort. You have never seen such wonder. You are still too far outside the Spaceport to see
      any more detail. You may return north to Megadon or enter the Spaceport to the south.
