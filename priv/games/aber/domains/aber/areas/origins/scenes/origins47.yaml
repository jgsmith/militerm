    short: &+BThe Temples of &+CSyrinx&n
    sight: >
      Upon first entering these buildings, the bleakness of the walls, all metallic grey, seem monotonous and
      foreboding. But upon further and closer examination, you see that they pulse with life!! Electronic
      signals and lights of origin unknown convey a deep sense of mystery. In its own way, the machinery of
      these rooms is alive; electronic impulses are its language and electricity is its oxygen... You get the
      feeling that the Temples and the things within them are as old as time itself, though nothing within has
      ever been seen before. As you approach the largest of the buildings, you realize that it is probably the
      central edifice of the group of Temples here -- a seat for the "town's" government. You enter the only
      room available, which seems to be the largest as well, and from its atmosphere, the most important.
      Three elaborate thrones dominate the center of the room, raised on a dias. On the lowest step of the
      dias is written "&+GElder Race&n". On each of the three thrones is a single word, beautifully rendered
      in flowing script. The left throne says "&+rRed Star&n", the right one "&+RSolar Federation&n" and the
      central throne reads "&+CSYRINX&n". There are a myriad of computers, monitors, and sound equipment all
      over the room, all in perfect order. On the floor in the very center, right below the dias, is a
      pentagram inscribed within a circle, all in red. The topmost point of the pentagram points directly to
      the central throne.
