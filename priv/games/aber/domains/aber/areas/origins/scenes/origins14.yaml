    sight: >
      You are standing directly beneath the beautiful arch. The sunlight shines down directly upon you,
      granting a soothing, relaxing feeling. Due north, you see that a great black chasm has ripped the earth
      apart from the westernmost position of the city to its easternmost. It appears to be very deep and
      dangerous to negotiate.
