    sight: >
      You reach the stricken village of Willowdale, and right away wish you hadn't. Cries of anguish from
      stricken mothers and children pervade the heavy gloom. Depression falls heavier than a thick mantle
      here. There is not much to see, as all the homes and buildings have been shattered. The dreary path
      turns south towards a large castle, north into hellish woods, east towards dead land, or offers passage
      to the west back across the river.
