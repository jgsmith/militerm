    sight: >
      You exit the courtyard and reach the foot of a long flight of steps that seems to reach up forever. You
      seem to perceive some movement at the top of the stairs, but cannot from this distance ascertain exactly
      what it is. You may climb the steps or return north to the courtyard.
