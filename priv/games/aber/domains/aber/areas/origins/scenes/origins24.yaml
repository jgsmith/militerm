      This area east of Willowdale must once have been where the inhabitants of the city did their farming.
      But now, the once rich and fertile earth has been violently stripped of all semblance of fertility. It
      reminds you of deliberately washing salt into soil to make it infertile, only this is far worse. In
      front of you is a small mountain which appears to have some greenery growing on it, and doesn't appear
      difficult to climb. You may retreat back west to Willowdale, or climb the small mountain. The very life
      essence of the area is gone, leaving a cold, hard, empty shell. Clothes may warm the body, but they do
      not warm the soul...
