    sight: >
      You stand at the beginning of a fantastic forest, whose very trees seem to be as old as the earth they
      grow from. Despite the density of the foliage, the sunlight shines through nearly unobstructed. The
      majesty of these trees gives you a sense of smallness... A well-worn path leads north into the forest.
