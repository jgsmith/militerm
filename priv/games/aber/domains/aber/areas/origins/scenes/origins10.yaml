    sight: >
      You come to the gates of the beautiful Elven city of Rivendell. They are carved lovingly out of the wood
      that surrounds everything here. Through them, you can see the fabled elven town. You doubt you've ever
      seen anything this magnificent before. The road leading north into the city has, however, fallen into
      severe disrepair.
