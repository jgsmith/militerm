      Fighting back to consciousness, coldness grips your skin. It suddenly becomes obvious to you that
      Panacea and Geddy Lee have sent you here for a reason. All around you, trees hang somberly about you,
      much resembling the willowy trees of swamps. You can't help but feel that the trees are watching your
      every move, with misshapen and contorted faces of agony. The road leads on into darkness to the north.
