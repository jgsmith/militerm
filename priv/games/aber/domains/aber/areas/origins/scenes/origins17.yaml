      You follow the voice and come to a beautiful waterfall, which cascades gently down the sides of the
      mountain. The waterfall feeds a large, round fountain, made of stone forged out of the very bowels of
      the mountain itself. The water in the fountain is perfectly crystal clear, and seems to glow white. The
      view here is even more spectacular than the one before, with the fountain and waterfall only enhancing
      its marvel. You want to stay here forever...
