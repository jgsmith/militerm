    sight: >
      You come upon a small, metallic, domed shelter, that appears as bleak as the entire area you are in.
      There is no concept of a 'yard' here, it would seem. However, though you cannot find any place to enter
      the house, you do hear the actual sounds of running water to your north! It is also possible to return
      east to Megadon.
