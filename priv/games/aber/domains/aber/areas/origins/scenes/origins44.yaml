    short: The Waterfall
    sight: >
      Lo and behold! Despite the total lack of organic material in all of Megadon, you have arrived at a
      beautiful waterfall, which gently cascades down the side of a tiny stone mountain into a small reservoir
      built for the purpose of holding the precious water. The road leads back south towards the house.
