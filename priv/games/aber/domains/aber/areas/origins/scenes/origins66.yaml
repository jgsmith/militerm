    sight: >
      You jump off of the zenith, and suddenly find yourself floating down gently in midair. You lose all
      sense of time or place, and enjoy the most wonderful feeling you have ever experienced. As you
      feather-fall down to the Temple of Paradise, you see three faces in front of you. To the left is the
      stern and solid face of Apollo, Bringer of Wisdom. To the right is the beautiful and kind visage of the
      Bringer of Love, Dionysus. And in the center is Cygnus, God of Balance. They all sing beautifully in
      unison to you: "&+WWe can walk our road together &+WIf our goals are all the same &+WWe can run alone
      and free &+WIf we pursue a different aim; &+WLet the truth of Love be lighted &+WLet the love of Truth
      shine clear &+WSensibilty &+WArmed with sense and liberty &+WWith the Heart and Mind united &+WIn a
      single, perfect Sphere...&n"
