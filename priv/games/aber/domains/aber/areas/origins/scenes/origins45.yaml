    short: The Cave
    sight: >
      You walk underneath the waterfall and enter a small cave. The interior of the cave contains a bed, a
      table, and other small living essentials. It is otherwise void of anything else. The walls here are
      actual stone, not metal. The cave's exit is to the south, and at the far corner of the interior, you
      spot a flight of steps.
