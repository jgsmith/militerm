      The ship starts to move slightly, and the slight hum you heard increases in intensity to nearly
      intolerable levels! The ship suddenly lurches upward, and you feel like you are going to be sick. Your
      ears pop, your vision blurrs, and you feel faint. But you know that there is no turning back now. As
      soon as the dome of the planet is cleared, you begin to feel accustomed to the travel. Through the
      windows, you can see the very stars you saw at night back home. Meanwhile, brave Neil Peart tells you a
      story: "&+WIn the constellation of Cygnus, there lurks a mysterious, &+Winvisible force; the Black Hole
      of Cygnus X-1. Six stars of the &+WNorthern Cross, in mourning for their sister's loss, in a final
      &+Wflash of glory, nevermore to grace the night...&n"
