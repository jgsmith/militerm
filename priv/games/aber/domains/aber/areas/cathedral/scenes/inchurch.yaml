    sight: >
      Inside the church, you look down a short aisle at the simple altar, its altarpiece &+Cilluminated
      &+Wbrilliantly&* by the &+Ylight&* from its small clerestory windows above your head. Though tiny, this
      church has a spiritual quality to it that is quite refreshing. By the altar sits a plate for donations.
