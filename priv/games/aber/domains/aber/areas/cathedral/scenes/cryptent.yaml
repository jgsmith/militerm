    sight: >
      The walls here are made up entirely of hideous snarling gargoyles. The dark &+Lgrey&* stone is damp and
      &+Bcold&* to the touch. You feel a &+Cchill&* set in that goes straight to your bones. Exits lead north
      and south, but you wonder if it isn't better to turn tail and run back to the east. The outline of a
      door marks the wall to the west. No handles or other markings appear on the wall.
