    sight: >
      The Western Facade of the Cathedral looms up before you into the &+Wmisty &+Csky&*. A triad of grand
      portals lie before you. Each is flanked by monolithic jamb statues, sculptured figures which stand flat
      against the architecture, and watch over the portals to this mighty cathedral. You are struck by the
      malign expressions on their faces, for they look much more like grinning &+Rdevils&* than the holy
      figures one would expect to find at the doors of a mighty church.
