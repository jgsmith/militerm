    short: The Crossing Bay
    sight: >
      This is the crossing bay, where the nave and the transept cross. The transept hall lies to the north and
      south. To the east the nave continues through the choir and toward the apse. A fountain sits here,
      burbling. As you peer down into the fountain, you notice it runs &+Rred&* with &+rblood&*, rather than
      &+Wclear &+Bwater&*, and yet it looks strangely tantalizing.
