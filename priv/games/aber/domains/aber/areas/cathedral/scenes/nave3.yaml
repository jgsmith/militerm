    sight: >
      Where once this Nave inspired awe, now only &+Ldarkness&* reigns, the &+Wlight&* of &+Yheaven&* can no
      longer shine in, and the place takes on an air of &+bgloom&* matched by few places you have ever been
      in. The columns to the north and south seem to tower menacingly over you. Through these columns lie the
      side aisle which runs along the nave. To the east is the crossing bay, and to the west the nave
      continues toward the portals.
