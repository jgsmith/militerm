      This reliquary is meant to house the &+Yholy grail&*, fabled to have been used by Jesus himself at the
      last supper. The case is empty, and you see no trace of the &+Ygrail&*. You find it odd that so many
      churches claim to have the &+Yholy &+Ygrail&*, but you assume that as long as these people think their
      grail is THE grail, thats all that matters.
