    sight: >
      You are partway down the nave. The wall of columns continues to your north and south. Thick, &+Ldark
      &+rred&* stains mar the columns. You can make your way to the side aisles through any of the archways
      between the columns. To the west the nave continues toward the royal portals. To the east it leads
      toward the choir and the apse. Several chairs, broken and battered, are strewn about the floor.
