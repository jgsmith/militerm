    sight: >
      Long ago crowds lined up along this aisle, waiting to see the holy relics housed in the east end of the
      cathedral. Now the mosaic paintings they once appreciated while they waited are in disrepair. Tiles
      litter the floor, and what is left of the wall mosaics is covered in a thick coat of &+Lgrunge&*.
