      You plunge face first into &+Beternal &+Ldarkness&*, never to be heard from again. Perhaps you will
      appreciate the messages in sculpture more in the afterlife. As you look on from above, the figures on
      the portal pack themselves more tightly together, and another figure, shaped like you, with a split
      skull for a head, emerges from the marble wall to join them.
