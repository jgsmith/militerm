      The walls here alternate between towering engaged corinthian columns and flat surfaces of marble
      brickwork. Flowing red velvet drapery falls between the columns. High above, shrouded in mist, is the
      single groin-vault that forms the ceiling of this crypt. Your breath echoes off the walls, disturbing
      the solitude that this chamber provides. The space is dominated by a platform upon which rests a lone
      sarcophagus.
