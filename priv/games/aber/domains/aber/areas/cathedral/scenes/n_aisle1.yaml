    sight: >
      The walls to the west and north are made of huge blocks of marble, stained by centuries of &+bgrime&*
      and &+gfungi&*. The wall to the north is interrupted by a large &+ywooden&* door, with metal handles.
      The door is swung back, and beyond it you can make out only &+Ldarkness&*. Howling sounds reach your
      ears from beyondthe doorway. To the east the aisle continues.
