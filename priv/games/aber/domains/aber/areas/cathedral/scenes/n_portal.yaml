    sight: >
      You step into the &+Ldarkness&* of the portal, and to your surprise the way to the east appears clear,
      though it leads into complete &+Ldarkness&*. The jamb statues here are the most hideous of all. Their
      heads are mere skulls, some of which display gaping cracks, thier feet rest upon what appear to be the
      artists rendition of bodies &+ydecaying&*.
