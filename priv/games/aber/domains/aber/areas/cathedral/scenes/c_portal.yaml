    sight: >
      This is the grandest of the three portals. Overhead you can barely make out the details of its bizarre
      tympanum sculpture. Above the door, in a half moon shaped area enclosed by a pointed arch, is a
      sculpture of an enthroned man, hooded and wearing a flowing cape which is tattered at the ends. His arms
      are outstretched and underneath them, smaller figures writhe in agony, as tiny swirling demons whip
      around their heads and torment them mercilessly. The Door itself is heavily boarded, and though it looks
      worn and battered, the &+ywood&* holds firm at any attempt to force your way through.
