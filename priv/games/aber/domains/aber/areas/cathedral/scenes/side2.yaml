    sight: >
      As you exit the cathedral, the door slams shut, and its heavy bolts fall into place. You can hardly see
      a thing through the thick &+Wfog&*. Wraithlike forms swoop down at your head making you duck in terror.
      You can fight them, but it is unlikely you can budge the door, should you survive the battle.
