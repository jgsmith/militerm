    sight: >
      These stairs seem to spiral up endlessly, and you wonder if you have gone so high as to rise above even
      the &+Lstorm&* which is brewing above the cathedral. As finally approach the top, a great &+Ylight&*
      shines down upon you which seems to answer your question, that in fact you have climbed a very long way.
