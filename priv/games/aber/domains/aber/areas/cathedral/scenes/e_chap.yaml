    sight: >
      This chapel is the largest of the five. The walls here are decorated with fine paintings of St. Suorac.
      Against the wall is a large reliquary, in which the bones of St. Suorac were supposed to be stored.
      Unfortunately they never made it here since according to the Priest he was killed by the vampire, and
      the cathedral turned into a &+rdemonic &+blair&*.
