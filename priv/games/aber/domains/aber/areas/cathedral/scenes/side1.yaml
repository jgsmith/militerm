      The &+Csky&* above seems lighter here, and the winds fade. you are surrounded by walls of &+Ggreen&* on
      all sides but north. In that direction, surrounded bythe &+givy&* that crawls all about the sides of the
      cathedral, is a heavy &+ywooden&* door, with a quite substantial lock of a type you've never seen the
      likes of.
