    sight: >
      As you step onto the path, you see a towering giant to the east. The cathedral rises high into the air,
      its twin towers soaring above even the &+Lstorm&* clouds which brew overhead, and add an air of
      &+ggloom&* to the place. Strong winds lash at your flesh, urging you away. A wall of &+Gbushes&* looms
      to the south.
