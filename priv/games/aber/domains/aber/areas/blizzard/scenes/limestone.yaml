    sight: >
      You are in a beautiful limestone cave. Multi colored stalactites hang from the roof forming amazing
      patterns of brilliant color. The floor is similarly decorated with a huge variety of stalagmites. A
      man-made corridor leads west, and a dim and moldy passageway winds southward.
