    sight: >
      You are in a large cavern. Huge stalagmites have grown up almost to the ceiling, in places actually
      merging with the multicolored stalactites above. To the south you perceive a great hall, and a fetid
      odor comes from the west. A small, low-walled &+Bwell&* occupies the center of the cave.
