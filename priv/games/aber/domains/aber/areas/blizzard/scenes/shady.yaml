    short: Shady Clearing
    sight: >
      You are in a shady clearing surrounded by proud and mighty oaks. The oaks are surrounded by hollies and
      thick bushes, while creepers and weeds girdle their ancient trunks. There is a route from the clearing
      to the north and there is a path that leads off to the east.
