    short: The Hall Of Fire
    sight: >
      You are in the hall of fire. The very walls are tinged with a fiery radiance, as if the rock itself is
      burning. A red pentacle is near one wall beside a picture carved in the wall. A lever on one wall is
      beside a huge metal drawbridge. A passage leads east.
