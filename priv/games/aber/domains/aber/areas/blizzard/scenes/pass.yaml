    sight: >
      You are trudging through deep snow as you follow a narrow track that winds down the pass leading
      southward, its end hidden by a succession of rocky spurs that jut out from either side. On both sides of
      you the mountains tower high above the pass, their peaks veiled in clouds. At one point, however, the
      cliff is nowhere near as steep and a fair way up a single window has been cut, looking out across the
      snows.
