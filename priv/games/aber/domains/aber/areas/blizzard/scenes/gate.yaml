    sight: >
      You are outside The Gate of Sorcerors. Its mighty pillars tower up around you, shielding you from the
      worst of the regular snowfalls and from some of the icy winds. The ancient arched gateway between the
      pillars leads north into a wide magically lit passage which disappears into the roots of the earth. You
      may enter the gate to the north, a lighted inn to the east, or trudge south into the snows.
