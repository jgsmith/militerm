    short: The Valley
    sight: >
      You are in a green and fair valley amidst the gently murmuring oaks. The sun shines gently through the
      trees sending dancing, golden beams rippling across the shadowy grass while midges dance between the
      branches. One particularly large oak tree rises up to the north.
