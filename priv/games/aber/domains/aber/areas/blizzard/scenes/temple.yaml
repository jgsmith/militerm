    sight: >
      You are in a sinister temple. Hideous shapes seem to reach out of nothing- ness towards you and vanish
      as immaterial shadows. The whole room radiates a crushing sense of power filling you with awe and dread.
      A huge fire burns at an end of the temple, seemingly without a source. Doorways lead lead north and
      east.
