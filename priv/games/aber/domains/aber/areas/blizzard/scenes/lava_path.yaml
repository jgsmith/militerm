    sight: >
      You are on a narrow sloping path running uncomfortably close to the lava. Huge explosions of lava send
      blasts of intense scorching heat across the path. The path leads eastwards but the intense red glow and
      heat haze prevents you from seeing where to. A steep climb heads up.
