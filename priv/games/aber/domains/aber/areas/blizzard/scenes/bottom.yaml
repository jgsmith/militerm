    sight: >
      You are at the bottom of the crevasse. Daylight, and a great deal of snow, comes through the top of the
      crevasse. A single man-made passage leads east into a strange temple. Another passage that doesn't
      exactly look man-made, more like a melted tunnel disappearing into the depths, lies west.
