    short: Mummification Room
    sight: >
      An eerie feeling along with an overwhelming odor assaults you as you step inside this room. On tables
      lie metal implements that looked to be instruments of torture. Jars holding palm wine, cedar oil and
      other astringents sit underneath. Stacks of &+Wwhite&N linen rest in an open chest. It isn't hard to
      discern the purpose of this room when you spy the body of freshly wrapped mummy lying on a high granite
      slab. Though the stone appears to be clean, you can see traces of a &+rrust&N-colored substance.
      Shivering at the thought of coming to such and end, you feel the need to hurry from this place.
