    sight: >
      The glint of &+Ygold&N greets you as you move into the room. The carvings on the &+Yglided&N walls
      depict Isis, the Earth Goddess, mourning the death of her husband Osiris. Seeing the exquisitely lovely
      features of the small &+Ygolden&N statue sitting atop a low, long altar, you realize why she is also the
      Goddess of Magic and Guile. A small movement brings your attention to a young woman of breath-taking
      beauty by the altar. You look again in amazement for she so closely resembles the statue, making you
      wonder if you are seeing a living representation of the Earth Goddess -- or just a mirage. A pile of
      coins lies on the altar -- perhaps an offering, or a temptation?
