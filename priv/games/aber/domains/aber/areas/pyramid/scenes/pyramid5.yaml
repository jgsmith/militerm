      Thoughts of the treasure you might be able to plunder in the pyramid lures you farther into this sea of
      dunes. Off to the south, an ominous cloud of brown dust can be seen on the horizon. Caution urges you to
      retrace your steps before you are engulfed by a &+ysandstorm&N. Yet the enticing notion of the riches
      you might discover urges you to brace the weather ahead.
