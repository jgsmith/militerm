      You enter a wadi that contains a small pool of &+Lmurky water&N. Wisps of stunted &+ggrasses&N along
      with low, scrubby &+gbushes&N struggle to survive in the thin soil and intense &+rheat&N. Disappointed
      your long trek has come to such an abrupt end, you pause to rest. Sitting by the &+Bpool&N is a
      weary-looking nomad, who has also stopped to rest before attempting the hazardous journey back through
      the dune sea. The bulging water bag by his side makes you think it might be wise to carry along some
      extra water on the return trip.
