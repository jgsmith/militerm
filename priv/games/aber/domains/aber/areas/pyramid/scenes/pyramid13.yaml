    sight: >
      Pausing for a moment to allow your eyes to become accustomed to the lack of light in this passageway,
      you are amazed to find the walls are covered with brightly colored paintings that have not faded with
      the passage of time. Many of the gods are depicted in these wall paintings, Osiris, Annibus, Set and the
      goddess, Isis. A sense of unease fills your soul as you recall the &+Lcurse&N of Neferteri and you wish
      you could read the &+mhieroglyphs&N that accompany the paintings. To the east and west of you are
      &+Ldark&N rooms that look &+Ccold&N and &+Cuninviting&N.
