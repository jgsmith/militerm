      Your breath lodges in your throat as the &+Gglow&N from your torch reflects off the four &+Yglided&N
      shrines covering the walls. The air crackles with your excitement and with a hint of fear, knowing you
      must now face a creature of such monumental evil -- and power. An altar, cast in solid &+Ygold&N, rests
      in the center of the room. On it lies a &+Lblack&N-haired woman of such incredible beauty, you can not
      but wonder if she could possibly be real or just a mirage sent by the gods to taunt you. The sight of
      such indescribable loveliness lures you closer, as you ignore the faint warnings sounding in your mind.
