    sight: >
      Blinking your eyes, you are amazed to find that you're on the steps of a large, &+ysand&N scoured
      pyramid. Carved out of rock and made smooth by the constantly blowing wind, they lead up to a small,
      &+Ldark&N, opening. Excitment courses through you. You have traveled far, endured much and have finally
      found the tomb of Neferteri. Visions of the wealth she stripped from the people dance in your head,
      overshadowing all thoughts of the &+Lcurse&N.
