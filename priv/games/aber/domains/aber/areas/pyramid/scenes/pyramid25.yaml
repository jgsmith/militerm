    sight: >
      Though much smaller than the king's, this sarcophagus is as intricately carved. The royal emblems of
      Isis are inlaid with semi-precious stones. The face carved in the stone wears a look of suffering, holds
      the sadness of death in youth. Another set of &+mhieroglpyhs&N have been carved into the side. Tempted
      not to disturb the final rest of this tragic woman, you feel the need to tip-toe quietly away. Yet
      curiosity to gaze upon the funeral mask makes you pause.
