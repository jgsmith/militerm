      Stumbling out of the storm, you breath a sigh of relief to find yourself on a fairly stable path. After
      wiping the &+ysand&N from your eyes, you again see those strange, tiny &+Ctracks&N leading off to the
      north. Should you follow those odd tracks or try your luck climbing the large &+ydune &N that lies to
      the south which looks quite dangerous?
