    sight: >
      The glint of &+Ygold&N greets you as you step into the room. &+YGlided &N wood surrounds the door to the
      south, while pictures depicting the history of Neferteri and her rise to power are painted on the walls.
      All is there to see, her enslavement of the King and Queen, the pillaging of the royal treasure, the
      gathering and harnessing the powers of the &+yEarth&N, &+rSun&N, &+WWind &N and &+bWater&N. And the
      final abomination, her use of the &+Lblack&N arts to ensure her immortality. One scene in particular
      catches your eye, Neferteri's presentation of a small &+ggreen&N stone to Horus, the son of the gods,
      Isis and Osiris. Upon closer inspection of the door, you see a faint &+cglow&N emanating from the seals
      and realize it would take some powerful magic to break this seal. Off to the west is a &+Ldark&N you saw
      in the passageway. To the north lies stone steps leading to another level in the pyramid.
