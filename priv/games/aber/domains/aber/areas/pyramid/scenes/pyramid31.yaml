    sight: >
      The glow of &+Wlight&N at the top of the dusty staircase beckons to you. These walls are dingy and
      unadorned. There are no tracks in the light covering of dust upon the steps, indicating no one has
      passed this way in a very long time. An eerie silence has pervaded this place until all you can hear is
      your shallow breathing and the swift beating of your heart. A small oval cartouche is carved deeply in
      the corner of one wall.
