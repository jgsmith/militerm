      Immediately, you are engulfed in a swirling cloud of dust. Tiny grains of blowing &+ysand&N scour your
      skin, fill your lungs and obscure your vision. No longer can you see that tantalizing vision of a
      pyramid, and much to your dismay, you can not see to find a way out of this raging storm. Bitterly, you
      wonder if this is the &+Lcurse&N whispered about for centuries that would befall those who dared to try
      and find the hidden tomb of Neferteri.
