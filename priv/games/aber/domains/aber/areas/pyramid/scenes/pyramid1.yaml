    sight: >
      The path abruptly ends in a field of large rocks. Boulders, some nearly as tall as a man, bar your way.
      An unrelenting &+Ysun&N beats down upon you and you can taste the dust in the air. Pausing to catch your
      breath, you spy a small trail to the south imprinted with some tiny tracks. Would it be possible, you
      wonder, to squeeze between the rocks and continue your journey?
