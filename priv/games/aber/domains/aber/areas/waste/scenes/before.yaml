    sight: >
      You are standing on a vast windswept plain, formed entirely of black volcanic dust. The dark gloomy
      wastes extend as far as your eye can follow, reflecting strangely against a fiery red sky... The only
      landmark in sight is a huge golden citadel whose walls reflect the flames and blood-red glow of the
      hellish skies above.
