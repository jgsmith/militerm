    short: Fiery Passage
    sight: >
      You are walking down a narrow fiery passage, the walls glow and pulsate with a dull red light. You have
      to tread carefully to avoid burning yourself on some of the hotter parts of the floor. The passage leads
      east and west, and a turning leads north towards a fiery pit.
