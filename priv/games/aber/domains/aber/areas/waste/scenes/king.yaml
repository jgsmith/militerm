    sight: >
      You stand in a small fantastically carved hall, decorated with millions of reflecting crystals which
      collect the fiery red which glows through a huge glass dome high above you, and scattering it around the
      hall, so that the ruddy glow of its walls burns like some incandescent hell. There is a small bronze
      door to the east.
