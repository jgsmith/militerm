      You are standing in a wide open room. The ceiling ends in a fancy wave of rolled gold, which artfully
      reflects the fiery red skies down across the pools of molten metal which form the centerpiece of the
      room. The light from the skies and the molten pits flickers around the room, flashing off the polished
      and carved golden walls.
