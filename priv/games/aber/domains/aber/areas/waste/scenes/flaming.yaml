    short: The Flaming Gates
    sight: >
      You are standing before a set of gigantic flaming gates, wrought entirely of a strange, blood tinged
      gold. The gates reflect the hellish, fiery red glow from two huge lava channels which flank the path you
      walk. To the east through the gates everything becomes a confusing mass of reflected flames against
      gold.
