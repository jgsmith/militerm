    sight: >
      You have enter the northwestern corner of the island. You notice a significant difference in the sea
      north and the sea to the west. You are drenched as a five foot wave crashes on the rocks about five feet
      north of you. The breeze from the north almost blows you to the ground and you struggle against it. The
      shore continues to the south and east.
