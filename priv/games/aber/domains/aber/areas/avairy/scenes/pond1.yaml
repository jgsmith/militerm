    sight: >
      You can't help but stop to relax in the peacefulness of your surroundings. Water flows swiftly into the
      pond from a small waterfall to the west. You can't help but wonder where the water flows to. Small birds
      chirp, flying from tree to tree and the sun shines down to the clearing in the trees.
