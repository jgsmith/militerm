    sight: >
      You are in a dark, dank cave. It appears to be man made by the shaping of the walls. Mist blows in from
      the shoreline to the north giving a strong fishy oder. The ground is all a white sandy color except for
      one corner of the cave where orange and yellow clays appear.
