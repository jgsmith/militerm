    sight: >
      This is the western shore line of Avairy Island. The waves to the west are not as bad as most you have
      seen from the island. The breeze here is significantly weaker than that of other parts of the island and
      sweat begins to form on your forehead. A cave entrance allows passage east, while the shore line
      continues north and west.
