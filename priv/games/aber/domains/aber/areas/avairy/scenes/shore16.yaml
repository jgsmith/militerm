    sight: >
      A large bird flies over head and you wonder why he is circling you. It is almost like you are being
      watched. The waves from the north spray you with mist as they break on large jagged rocks. Passage south
      is blocked as a large cliff darts up twenty feet into the air. The shore line continues east and west.
