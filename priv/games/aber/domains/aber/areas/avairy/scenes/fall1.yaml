    short: A Cave Under the Falls
    sight: >
      You are in a dark, mildewy cave beneath the waterfall. Water leaks in through the dirt roof over your
      head causing a constant dripping noise. The walls of the room are lined with paneling which you note
      looks extremely flimsy in one particular spot and sways as if there is a hole behind it. Footprints in
      the dirt floor are extremely hardened and it does not appear that anyone has been down here in quite
      some time.
