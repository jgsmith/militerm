    sight: >
      Well, it looks like the Genie has granted your wish! You are in a parade heading into Agrabah, home of
      the beautiful, and unmarried Princess Jasmine! Crowds line the streets just waiting to catch a single
      glimpse of you. You bow and wave to your cheering fans as you are bombarded with an abundance of
      flowers.
