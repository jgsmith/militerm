      You walk through a large open lion's mouth and find yourself in the Cave of Wonders. As you move
      forward, a voice growls, "Only those of purest heart may enter." There is a long stairway in front of
      you leading down into the darkness of the lion's throat. You may also chicken out and go back up.
