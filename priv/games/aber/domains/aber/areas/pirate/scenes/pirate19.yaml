    sight: >
      You are standing in front of a large, pillared archway. In between the pillars you see a hazy cloud,
      through which the moors can be seen. This is strange though, for when you look behind the archway, all
      you can see is a large cliff, at the bottom of which you can see waves crash. A path extends off to the
      north here, winding down the side of the volcano.
