    sight: >
      You are standing on the shore of a lovely tropical island. White sand extends along the shoreline. The
      western horizon is dominated by a huge volcano. To the west a small path leads to a tunnel that cuts
      into the heart of the volcano. Another small path leads off to the south, winding its way up the side of
      the volcano, and small bushes can be seen to the north.
