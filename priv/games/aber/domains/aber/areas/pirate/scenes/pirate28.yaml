      You are in what was once the home of the high priest, but is now the lair of the mermaid. Various
      trinkets of the surface world line the room for decoration, and a soft bed of seaweed is in one corner.
      At the north end of the room, a large arch is built into the wall. Through the haze that fills the
      center of the arch, you can make out a clearing in a forest. A doorway leads back into the altar room to
      the east.
