      You are in a large room with several long tables. Sawdust covers the floor, and scraps of food litter
      both it and the tables. Smokey light streams in from several portholes lining the walls, but it does
      nothing to lighten the mood of the place. A small doorway leads off to the west, a hallway extends to
      the south, and a large door stands in the middle of the north wall.
