      You are in the ship's hold, apparently just a rather large, open space. It is immediately obvious that
      the pirates have transported a large variety of objects in their ship, for you see everything from
      scraps of cloth to animal droppings littering the floor. To the south, a large door leads to the rest of
      the ship.
