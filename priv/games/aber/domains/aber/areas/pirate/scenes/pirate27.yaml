    sight: >
      You are standing amid the pews in the main room of the temple. Murals of hobbits in a number of
      activities cover the walls, giving the room a cheerful appearance. On the altar at the front of the room
      is what appears to be the remains of food, apparently some sort of offering to the Gods. Exits lead to
      the east, south, and west.
