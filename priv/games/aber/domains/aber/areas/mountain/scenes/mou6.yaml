    sight: >
      A shower of rain has suddenly turned the earlier so dry and barren desert into a sea of small but
      colorful flowers. The raincloud is slowly moving west and the sun casts its' first rays upon this
      scented little paradise. You sit down on the ground enjoying the peace and silence surrounding you.
