    sight: >
      The sun has reached the zenith as you arrive at the edge of a desert. Your feet start feeling heavy and
      you think this is your last chance to check your water bottle. To the south you can see the rocky lands
      continuing far out of your sight. To the north the desert turns into thick thorny bushes.
