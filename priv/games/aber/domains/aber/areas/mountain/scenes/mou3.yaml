    sight: >
      Through the burning heat an dry rocky desert you stomp and stop for a moment to have a look around. The
      sand reflects the heat making you hope it was night. You are desperately trying to distinguish reality
      from mirage. You think you see paths leading in each direction. To the south you can narrowly recognize
      a red hill breaking the horizon.
