    sight: >
      Crystal clear blue waves break against an endless beach of white sand. Conch shells, palm trees, and sea
      stars dot the land as you walk barefoot at the edge of the water while red and pink clouds chase a
      setting sun down the horizon. In the distance you see a group of dolphins leaping out of the waves. You
      could stay here forever.
