    sight: >
      Here you find more rooms. To the north you hear waves crashing against a beach. Through the south exit
      you see trees and seashells but no people. From above you wafts the smell of apple pie and coffee. To
      the east you see blackness, while to the west you smell a breeze of pepermint wind. You could always go
      back down.
