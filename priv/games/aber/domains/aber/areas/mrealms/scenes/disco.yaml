      You've not only traveled to the south room but also traveled back in time to a place where Disco is
      still alive and King, drugs are bountiful, afros are still cool, and bell-bottoms are a must. Strobe
      lights flash against a huge disco ball hanging from the ceiling, giving the entire room a dream-like
      look. People crowd the room, trying to stay alive, swearing as long as they know how to love they know
      they'll be alright, screaming at the DJ to play that funky music white boy, and other corny song
      allusions.
