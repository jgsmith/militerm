    sight: >
      A sheet of water falls before you, glistening in all the colours of the rainbow. You reach out your hand
      through the water and slivers bounce off onto the walls of the cave you found. Looking back into the
      cave you see the drawings of ancient peoples, although you don't believe this cave has been inhabited
      since they were drawn. A cool breeze sends a light mist of water toward you, for which you are thankful
      after the heat of the day.
