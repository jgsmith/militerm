    sight: >
      A never-ending sea of green rolling hills stands before you, dotted with specks of wild flowers of all
      colours. You pick up a pink buttercup and put it in your hair while making a coronet of clover. You
      cannot resist the urge to lie down in the thick green grass. Maybe it's the poppies making you sleepy.
