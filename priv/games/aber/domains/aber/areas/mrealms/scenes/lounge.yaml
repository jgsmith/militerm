    short: The Mortal Lounge
    sight: >
      You step into the lounge and begin to feel relaxed right away. A large plush couch sits right in the
      middle of the room with a large coffee table in front of it. A refridgerator stocked with the finest
      ale's and various types of soda is built into the north wall. Set into the west wall is a big screen TV
      with a Sony Playstation resting on the floor in front of it. Next to the TV is a stereo system playing
      dance mix music. Set into the east wall is a wetbar with a glowing neon sign that says 'Always Open'. So
      please, pour yourself a drink, sit back and relax.
