    sight: >
      A burly waitress with a name tag which says Sally asks you what you'll have. The stools around you are
      empty, and booths filled with lovers, teenagers celebrating a victory, and truck drivers taking a break
      line the windows. The jukebox has all your favourite songs in it . . . only costs a quarter, so go ahead
      and give it a go. I recommend the apple pie.
