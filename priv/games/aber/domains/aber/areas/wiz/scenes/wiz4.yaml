    sight: >
      You have arrived at Stonehenge. Here atop this green hill sit ancient rectangular rocks, each weighing
      several tons. Every time you approach one of them, you feel a pulse of power run through you, soft but
      constant. In the center of the arrangement is an altar of stone, used long ago for weddings of pagan
      peoples. Looking out past the hill you see the entire Promised Land stretched out below, as bluebirds
      and eagles swoop energetically in the sky. You notice quite suddenly that all your troubles have fled
      from you, leaving you feeling happy and at peace.
