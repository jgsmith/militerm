      This is where Brain spends his time when he is not trying to take over the real world, or one of several
      MUDs. It's a &+Ggreen&* cage, quite a bit like his cage in Acme Labs. There is a wheel in the corner
      which Pinky is convinced that he is making progress on. The walls are plastered with posters of
      Einstein, and possible plans to take over the world. With a little work, and some stolen &+Bmagic&* from
      Merlin's book of spells, Brain has created &+Cshimmering&* portals, much like what he uses to teleport,
      for mortals to return to their realm.
