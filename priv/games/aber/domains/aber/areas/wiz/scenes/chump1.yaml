    sight: >
      The grassy field that you have entered makes you feel lonely. You wonder what kind of Chump makes this
      place their home. The southern path leads back to civilization whille to the north you see a lake. You
      begin to feel lost and confused when you peer at the lake in the distance for too long. Maybe you should
      return the way you came and seek adventure elsewhere.
