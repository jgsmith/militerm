    sight: >
      You come out of the last spin, and are abruptly deposited on a slide made of some slick metal. You
      descend rapidy, being abruptly slammed against the walls as the slide banks through several tight
      corners. Ahead of you, approaching rapidly is a small point of &+Ylight.
