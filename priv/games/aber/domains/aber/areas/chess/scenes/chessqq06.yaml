      You pop out of the slide, sail through the air for several long moments, crash into the side of a
      cavern, and land on a ledge in a crumpled heap. You slowly look upwards, and what you see astounds even
      you- a seasoned adventurer. You are in the north end of a perfectly square cavern with a floor composed
      of sixty-four alternating black and white marble tiles. Giant torches line the walls, casting a dazzling
      glow over the entire room. Standing guard over half the squares are giant carved wooden beings, looming
      and silent. There is a neat wooden &+yladder&* beneath you, leading downward, and three quarters up the
      opposite wall is the small hole you just came flying out of.
