    sight: >
      As you step onto the dock, it sags crazily and settles more firmly into the river. A sudden bright light
      shines out from upriver, blinding you momentarily. The light approaches closer, and you realize that it
      is some strange form of boat. It stops at the north side of the dock, ready to be boarded.
