    sight: >
      This crack between two rock faces is barely wide enough for an armored human to squeeze through. It
      rises sharply at its midpoint, and an icy wind blows north to south, from the high end... a snowy
      mountainside can be seen beyond. To the south, a rocky field offers more warmth and comfort.
