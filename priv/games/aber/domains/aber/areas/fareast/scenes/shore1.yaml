    sight: >
      The beach ends abruptly here, cut off by high cliffs on two sides, and the sea to the west. It is
      impossible to see what might be atop the tall cliff faces, but carved paths snake to the north and east,
      making it possible to travel there yourself. The beach stretches on to the south, where a ship floats in
      the harbor.
