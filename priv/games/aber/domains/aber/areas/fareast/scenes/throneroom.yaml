    sight: >
      The Throne Room's opulent surroundings are befouled by demon stench and brimstone haze, and the throne
      itself is smeared with grime and blood. Silk tapestries that once hung proudly on the walls have been
      apparently used as handkerchiefs and... toiletries. The daimyo and his court are piled on either side of
      the throne like so much cordwood, and your ire rises at such mocking destruction.
