    sight: >
      The vast, otherworldly aspect of this room takes some time to assimilate: The domed ceiling looks up
      into the sky, but the view is unencumbered by clouds, haze, or indeed, air. Bare suns and glowing
      nebulae illuminate the space in which you stand. Dragons wheel about these heavens occasionally,
      glancing down on you in amusement. And before you... before you is the Orb of Yin and Yang, capable of
      throwing the balance of creation to good or evil exclusively. The Demon could not harness its full
      power, so undoubtedly you cannot either, but even at its weakest the Orb could make you a formidable
      ruler... but it must be returned to its place. The steel arch that transported you in waits to the
      north, and a strange circular portal hovers to the south, visible but not solid.
