    short: Eastern Plateau and Overlook
    sight: >
      This side of the steep river valley offers a spectacular view of the eastern skyline... where a terraced
      shrine rises up before the forests that separate this area from the spires of the capitol, Eno. To the
      west, a rope bridge leads back across the valley, where a similar plateau offers a path downward toward
      the local village. A less steep path leads up from this side into a craggy hillside in the east, through
      which it will hopefully lead toward the temple.
