    sight: >
      The sky overhead seems to actively darken as you pass this way, going from a dim storminess to the
      north, to a sickly slate to the south, where dark branches reach hopelessly toward the swirling clouds.
      The road seems increasingly out of repair as you look in that direction, also.
