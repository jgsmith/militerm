      Blood stains the sheets of the Daimyo's bed, and his quarters show the signs of an attack. The wardrobe
      is over on its side, and its sides show evenly spaced slashes, like claw marks. Chairs and other small
      furniture lie smashed in one corner, and every one of the ruler's personal effects has been broken- his
      sword, his helmet, his seals, everything.
