    short: Chamber of Calm
    sight: >
      This chamber is hung with silk tapestries, elegant and heavy artworks valued more for their acoustic
      properties than their artistic ones. The room is silent and still, and a scent of incense floats in from
      the altar to the north. It is a perfect place to sit still, relax, and clear one's mind.
