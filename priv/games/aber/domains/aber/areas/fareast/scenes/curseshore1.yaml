    short: Shore of the Acid River
    sight: >
      A beach of black, glassy sand divides this area between a thick, blackened forest to the north and east,
      and a stinking, bubbling river of acid to the south. The river looks shallow enough that you could cross
      quickly, but you still might lose some boot leather.
