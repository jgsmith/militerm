      The ground is hard and glassy underfoot, and it is difficult to stand. The mists that cover the northern
      forest are unrestrained here, and seep down around your ankles, rising occasionally in choking plumes.
      To the west, a greyish building fights to stay above this flood, but its paper-thin walls have already
      been breached. The northern edge of this area is the shore of a foul yellowish river, and to the south,
      a wall of solid black stone rises to block the horizon.
