    sight: >
      Low stone benches form rows in this room, alternating with rows of cushions. A cold fireplace in the far
      wall holds enough utensils and pots for you to guess that this must be the dining hall for the temple.
      The room itself is also cold, as air leaks in from the southern doorway. A wooden staircase leads
      upward, into a room flickering with candlelight.
