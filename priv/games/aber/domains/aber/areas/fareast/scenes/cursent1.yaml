      Dark, gnarled branches reach over the road, marking a boundary between the merely grotesque and the
      completely twisted. The southern road splinters and falls to ruins before reaching the dark forest,
      leaving only brackish mud and loose stones to mark the way. Out to the north, the darkness thins and the
      road continues undamaged.
