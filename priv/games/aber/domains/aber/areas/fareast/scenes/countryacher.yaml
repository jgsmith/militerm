    sight: >
      Small orchards grow on either side of the road here, increasing in number the further you look to the
      east. This progression ends in a vast orchard of pink blossomed cherry trees. To the west, the land
      grows flatter and featureless, a farmed plain reaching to where this road crosses another.
