    sight: >
      This unpleasant countryside makes you look longingly to the north, where pink cherry blossoms fall from
      a thick, living orchard. The land here, in contrast, is dry and rocky, barely touched by greenery.
      Further to the south, it even seems to be dotted with dark, smoking puddles and patches of yellow ooze,
      ending in haze-shrouded cliffs. Another escape, however, is offered by a sinkhole to the west, where the
      roadbed drops away toward a bare, dry floor.
