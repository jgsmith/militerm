    short: On the Northern Cliffs- Beneath an Overhang
    sight: >
      The cliff face is worn away here, leaving an overhung, pocketed ledge large enough for two humans to
      stand under. The floor is strewn with small stones, but swept in places as if someone's feet had been
      placed there and moved in small circles. The ledge continues up and to the east, meeting up with a path
      from the beach to the cliffs. The only other way off this ledge is to descend to the beach, to the
      south.
