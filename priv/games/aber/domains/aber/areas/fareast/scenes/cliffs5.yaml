    sight: >
      Rising from the shoreline cliff-face, this narrow reach spans the northern side of the river valley. In
      fact, looking down, you can see the greenish ribbon swirling west toward the sea. However, it would be a
      dangerous drop from here to the floor below, so your only options are to travel east (ascending) or west
      (descending) along the path.
