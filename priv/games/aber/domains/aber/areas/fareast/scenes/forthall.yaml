      Your footsteps echo in the vast hallway, the only sound in this hollow emptiness. Timbers bracing the
      lofted ceiling are scraped along the underside, but the walls are unmarked. Passages lead off in the
      cardinal directions, with the one to the south opening onto the courtyard outside.
