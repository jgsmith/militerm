    short: Countryside- Crossroads
    sight: >
      The two major roads crossing this island meet here, at an unmarked crossroads. The only clue as to each
      road's destination is what can be seen: to the west, a small village stands alone. To the east, the road
      continues toward groves and orchards of planted trees. The northern path seems to dissappear into the
      rock-strewn hills, where mountains reach toward the horizon. And to the south, the road is obscured by a
      dark haze rising from the blighted countryside around it.
