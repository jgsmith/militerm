    sight: >
      Planted and cultivated trees form small orchards along the sides of this east-west road, thickening to
      the east until only a vast pink forest of blossoms is distinguishable. In the west, the trees become
      more and more sparse, giving way to fields and pasture, flat land that makes it easy to see where this
      path crosses another, forming a crossroads.
