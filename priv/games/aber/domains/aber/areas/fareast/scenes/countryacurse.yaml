    sight: >
      The once green countryside looks sickly now, as some blight spreads northward across it. Nothing stands
      higher than your calves, and what still stands is wilted, broken, or torn. Puddles of sticky black ooze
      bubble up in small patches, which become larger toward the south. The sickly vapors from these puddles
      rise and cast a dark haze over the entire southern sky, as well. At the far southern reach of this road,
      a dark forest tries feebly to block the skyline. To the north, healthier pastures abut the road.
