      Training took many forms for the students of this dojo, as the varied equipment here shows. Wooden
      targets, some broken, some bloodied, stand to either side of a straw ring, which is similarly stained
      and damaged. A few straw dummies dressed in clothing and armor were used to begin weapons training. Of
      course, there was no substitute for human instruction, and several marked areas on the floor undoubtedly
      served as sparring rings.
