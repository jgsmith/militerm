    sight: >
      Peasants comb the rice plants growing in the shallows here, gathering the grain and carrying the sacks
      back up to their village to the southeast. The peasants glance at you, but hurry away without asking
      questions, either too busy or too afraid to find out who you are. The stream flows from a slope to the
      north, curves here and continues down to a broad valley to the west, and presumably from there out to
      the sea.
