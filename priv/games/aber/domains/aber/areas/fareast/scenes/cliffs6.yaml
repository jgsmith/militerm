    sight: >
      The northern path up these cliffs ends abruptly at this point, rising to a flat plateau with only two
      ways off: to the south, where a path leads back down the cliff to the valley below, or to the east,
      across a narrow bridge formed of ropes and wooden poles. Across the bridge, a similar plateau leads to a
      higher cliffside.
