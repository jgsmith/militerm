    sight: >
      Fields and pastures have been carved into the rocky soil of this land, a sloping plain descending from
      the mountainous north toward the low, forested south. The road crossing this expanse runs east-west, and
      at its western terminus meets up with a small village of wooden buildings. Towards the east, the road
      meets with another at an unmarked crossing.
