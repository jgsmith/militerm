    sight: >
      A line of blossoming cherry trees abruptly divides the barren country- side from a tangled "orchard",
      stretching back beyond sight. The trees are so tightly packed that only the road offers a way through to
      the north. The southern end of the road disappears into the scrub and stone of a blasted plain.
