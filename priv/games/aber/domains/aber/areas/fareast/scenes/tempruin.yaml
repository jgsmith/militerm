      This was once a Shinto shrine outside Eno. Now, it is a pile of rubble beneath two cracked pillars. The
      main platform is largely intact beneath the rocks, but its surface has been scorched and scraped by
      something. Trees that once made this an oasis of nature near the city's walls have been torn down,
      giving you a clear view of those ramparts and the spires beyond.
