      The only standing building higher than two stories, other than the fortress itself, is this guard tower,
      set against the defensive wall. This lower floor held rows of bunks, which are now overturned and torn,
      as well as the armor and personal effects of the city's defenders. A plank staircase leads up to the
      open platform above.
