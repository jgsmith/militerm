    sight: >
      The stream here must once have been a powerful river, because the valley it cut is as wide as a small
      glacial rift. Trees and small shrubs reach up the walls of the gap, and the stream flows by to the west,
      where it will rejoin the sea. To the east, human figures move back and forth from a wide, shallow bank
      of the stream, to a forested area further to the southeast.
