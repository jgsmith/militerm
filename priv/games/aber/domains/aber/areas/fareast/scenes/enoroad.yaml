    short: Road to Eno
    sight: >
      The road stretches across the plain, from a cherry orchard far to the south to the vast city of Eno to
      the north. The city is plainly visible, a dark mass of spires and rooftops stacked one on another,
      surrounded by a palisaded earthen wall. Only the front edge of the orchard can be seen, with the road
      passing into a gap therein. The countryside is burnt and blasted, and a black streak crosses the road in
      front of you.
