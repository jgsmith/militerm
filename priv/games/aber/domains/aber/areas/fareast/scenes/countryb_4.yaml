    sight: >
      Sulfurous ooze laps across the road at its eastern end, seeming to eat away at the stone. A greyish
      miasma rises from this nasty yellow puddle, and the cold winds from the southeast blow it back past you;
      a choking, stinking vapor that burns your eyes. Looking for a way out of this cloud, you look west,
      where the road is still intact, and south, where a dirt path leads down to a small clearing.
