    short: Cave in the Cursed Lands
    sight: >
      This cave, though dark, damp, and cramped, is free of the choking vapours that swirl outside. You can
      actually breathe and rest here, without fearing attack or poisoning. A tiny, salt-rimmed tunnel seems to
      be the source of the restoring air, leading back to the west, far underground.
