    sight: >
      You are wandering amidst the thickets and stones far out upon the moor. Grey and barren they extend all
      around you. Thick gorse and bushes prevent even the most determined adventurer from doing anything but
      following the paths to the north and west. You spot an opening between the bushes to the southeast
      however. You also spot a cavern opening below you on the cliffside.
