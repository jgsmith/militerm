    short: The Stone Circle On The Moor
    sight: >
      You are standing in the center of an ancient circle of jagged stones hidden in a deep bowl in the center
      of the moors. Narrow scarcely used tracks wind up from the deathly quiet bowl. The center of the circle
      is a black gloomy altar to some ancient god.
