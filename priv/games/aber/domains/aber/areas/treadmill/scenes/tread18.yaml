      An unusual rock formation stands here where three tall wickedly sharp pointed rocks reach toward the sky
      as if they were stabbing at it from the depths of hades. It is believed that this has been a portal for
      underworld beings to enter the outer world and many that have walked into the middle of these three
      spiked rocks were never seen again. Hopefully this fable is just a tale told around the campfire.
