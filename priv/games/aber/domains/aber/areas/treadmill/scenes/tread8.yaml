    short: The New Treadmills of Hell, the Prequel
    sight: >
      Before the Treadmills of Hell, there was the Treadmills of Hell. It is the same as it was before, the
      same it is now, and the same it will be in the future. If you don't find a way out of here you'll be
      stuck down below forever.
