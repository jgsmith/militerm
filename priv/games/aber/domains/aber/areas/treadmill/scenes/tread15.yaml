      A large stone arch has formed over this location over thousands of years amid the other rocks and
      boulders that have formed from earthquakes, waves crashing against the shore and the occasional
      hurricane. What's so special about this arch that it has been said that nearby inhabitants of the land
      claim to have seen figures emerge from the arch from nowhere, a steady stream of them in fact. The
      locals hearby deemed it the devil's archway and kept their children from going near it fearing one may
      get sucked away to the 'other side'.
