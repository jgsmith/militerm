    sight: >
      You have traveled to a blind curve in the cliffside. It is a tight curve, one that is safer for walkers
      but very dangerous to those riding on wheels. It is said that many chariots, buggies, and carts have
      fallen off the edge at the curves tightest turn into a mighty chasm that looks like it goes all the way
      to the gates of Hades. Myths have been spread that occasionally something comes out of the chasm to
      haunt the nearby lands. Most people refuse to believe these myths however.
