      Here resides a gaping hole in the ground as a result of a meteor strike, smoothed and rounded out over
      thousands of years by rain and weathering. It is held by legend that this meteor strike opened a hole to
      Hades in which demons could leave their world and haunt nearby inhabitants. It looks like it can hold a
      large amount of punch for a party--its bowl is mostly granite.
