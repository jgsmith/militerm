      You have entered the crypt in which Jessimine has been buried. Light shines in from a hole at the top of
      the statue and illuminates the room. You see a picture of a woman, who you recognize as the Goddess, as
      well as several tapestries hanging on the walls depicting Jessimine's sister, her friends, and her true
      love.
