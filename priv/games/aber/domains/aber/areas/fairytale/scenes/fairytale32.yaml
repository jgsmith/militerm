    sight: >
      You stand in the prison. The air hangs heavy with the stench of rotted flesh and human waste. Chains and
      manacles hang from the walls, above piles of bones which lie in grim repose to the rest of the room. A
      small fire burns in one corner, made of rags and rat droppings.
