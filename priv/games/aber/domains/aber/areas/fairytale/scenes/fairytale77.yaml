    short: Treasure Chamber
    sight: >
      You have discovered the treasure chamber of the ancient priests of the rainbow tribe! The cavern is damp
      and cold, and the sights are as chilling as the air. Skeletons lie randomly around the room, as though
      thrown around by some giant hand. Scraps of fabrics and jewelry are visible mixed with the bones.
