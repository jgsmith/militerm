    sight: >
      You stand among a field of clouds. To the east, in the distance, you see a castle rising out of some
      white mountains. To the west, a huge rose towers above you. From the north you smell cotton candy and
      hear children laughing. Below you the vine reaches through the clouds and eventually reaches the ground.
