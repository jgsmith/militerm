      From here, you can see the entire room spread out below you. You are again amazed at the absence of
      dirt, and begin to feel rather grimy yourself. On the landing before you is an oak table and two oak
      chairs, all highly polished. A mouse-hole is set into the wainscoting of the wall, also clean.
