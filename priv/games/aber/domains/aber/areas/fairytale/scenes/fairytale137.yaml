      You have entered a large, lavishly-decorated room. This must be the end of your quest, for among the
      gold brocade and silver furniture is a coffin. A throne rests against the north wall, inlaid with
      expensive gems. A crown rests on the throne, also inlaid with shining stones. A closet filled with
      valuable robes and gowns is against the east wall. The coffin is made of an alloy which you do not
      recognize, which seems to reflect the light. The coffin has been carved with Sleeping Beauty's name and
      face.
