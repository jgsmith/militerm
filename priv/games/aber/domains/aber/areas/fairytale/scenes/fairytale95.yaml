      A beautiful room is spread out around you. A crystal box shines in the center of the room, illuminated
      by light pouring in through a large picture window. Around the box are seven small people, perhaps
      dwarves. As you enter they look up at you with pleading eyes, as though begging something from you.
      Lying in the box is a beautiful woman with pale skin and black hair. In her dainty hand she holds an
      apple with one bite missing. You look around the room and see a sign which proclaims that 'Only a prince
      may awaken the sleeping beauty.'
