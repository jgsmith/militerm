      The owners of this house seem to have left, perhaps to take a walk through the forest. The basic number
      of the house appears to be three: Three bowls stand on the table, steaming softly, three chairs sit
      around the triangular table, three LA-Z-Y BEAR chairs rest around the fireplace, and three steps lead up
      to the sleeping loft.
