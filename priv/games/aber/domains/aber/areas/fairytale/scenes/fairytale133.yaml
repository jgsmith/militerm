      The east wall of this room is covered with spools of thread. Two cabinets are set up in the northeast
      and southeast corners of the room; each is open and filled with fabric. Dressmaker dolls stand around
      the room, with half- finished clothing hanging from them. Four large tables have been pushed against the
      west wall for cutting and sewing. To the south is a large room, and to the north is a room full of
      tapestries.
