      You enter a large, cave-like room. Doors lead to the north, west, and south, but gossamer-like strands
      of webbing stretch across them and bar them from your use. The only clear door is the one you entered
      from, to the east. In the center of the room is a crib, in which a sack full of gold rests, but the
      webbing covers it as well. Following the strands with your eye, you realize that they originate from a
      spinning wheel which lies in the corner.
