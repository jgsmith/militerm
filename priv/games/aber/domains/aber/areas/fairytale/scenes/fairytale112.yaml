      The first thing you notice about this room is the large pipe which sticks out of the ceiling. From it, a
      trickle of water runs down into a large cavity in the floor. From below, you hear the sound of rushing
      water, as if from an underground river. It would appear that you have discovered an early form of sewer
      system.
