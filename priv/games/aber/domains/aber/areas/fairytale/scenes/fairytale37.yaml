    sight: >
      Two arched doors stand before you on the eastern wall. They are elaborately carved, and seem to tell a
      story of a man named Jack who stole many things from a giant. The story ends with a panel of a large man
      eating a sandwich, from which two feet protrude. To the west, you see colored light streaming in through
      the open door. The walls are decorated with portraits of important giants of history.
