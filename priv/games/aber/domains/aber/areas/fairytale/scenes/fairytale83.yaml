      A flight of stairs rises above you, and as you follow the spiral with your eyes, you find your gaze
      straying to the decorations on the walls. Swords, shields, and various multi-colored banners hang in
      colorful displays, and are interspersed with arched windows and oil lamps. Your head begins to spin as
      your blood drains from it, and you tear your gaze away from the walls to focus on the floor. There you
      see a rug which looks like a psychedelic snake. The rug continues up the stairs.
