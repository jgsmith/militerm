    sight: >
      The river flows through a hole in the ground here, which is easily eight feet in diameter. Above the
      hole hangs a cloud of mist, and a rainbow arcs through the cloud. The river roars as it plunges through
      the hole, and feel yourself slowly growing deaf. Through the cloud you can vaguely make out the entrance
      to a cave.
