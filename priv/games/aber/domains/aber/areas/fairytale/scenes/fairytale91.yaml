    short: The Three Pigs
    sight: >
      This residence appears to be the brick home of the three little pigs. The smell of a finely-cooked stew
      assails your nose, apparently emanating from the pot over the cooking fire. The entire house is built of
      brick, and is done in the style known as 'early swine', Pictures of famous pigs line the walls, such as
      Porky, Penelope, and Miss Piggy. A newspaper on the end-table advertises the opening of a new
      Piggly-Wiggly supermarket, and lies next to an illustrated version of 'Charlotte's Web'. Small porcelain
      pigs are displayed prominently in a case on the wall.
