      You stand on one side of a cliff. On the other side you see a castle, and in front of the castle is a
      bridge mounted on wheels. Far below you you see a smoking crater in the earth, as though something had
      somehow burned through the original bridge on its way down. A drawbridge is here, mounted on wheels.
