    sight: >
      Books line the walls of this large room, filling you with awe of anyone who could have read them all.
      Classics such as "Moby Dick", "Pride and Prejudice" and "Treasure Island" are prevalent, mixed with
      lesser-known works such as "The Dark is Rising" and the "Books of Blood". Four doors lead from this
      room: one returning to the north, one to the east marked 'Alice', one to the west marked 'Peter', and
      one to the south marked 'Dorothy.' Through each is a different scene, all of which look somehow
      familiar. . . .
