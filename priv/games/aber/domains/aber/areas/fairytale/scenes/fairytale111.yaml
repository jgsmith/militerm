    sight: >
      You are in a large room, dominated by a huge furnace. The furnace has a large steel grate mounted on it,
      through which you can see flaming coals. A small pile of coal lies here, next to a shovel. A tube
      extends from the roof of the furnace to the ceiling of the room. To the south is the coal room, and to
      the west you can hear a gurgling noise, as though water were running there.
