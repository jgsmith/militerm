    sight: >
      You have entered the cold storage cellar. Foods such as meat and wine were stored here in barrels of
      salt, such as those you see lying around. A heavy iron door is set into the north wall, which is warm to
      the touch. The cellars smell faintly musty, although the walls are clean. A staircase leads up to the
      pantry.
