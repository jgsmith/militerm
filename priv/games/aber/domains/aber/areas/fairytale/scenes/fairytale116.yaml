      You have entered the largest of two bedrooms. To the west is the bathroom, and to the south is the
      hallway. A large bed rests here beneath a canopy, which is supported by four elaborate oak posts. A
      closet stands next to the window. A small desk dozes quietly near the east wall, covered with papers.
