      Sleeping Beaty's cooks did not leave in a hurry. They out away their many utensils in racks on the wall.
      The feast, left out on the table for travellers, has long since rotted away. To the west of you is the
      entry room, to the south is the pantry, and to the north is the living room. A table is here, bolted to
      the floor, scarred by knives and stained with dried blood.
