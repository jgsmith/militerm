    sight: >
      You have entered a large room, in which the family commonly spent time before the Time of the Great
      Sleep. Couches and chairs are spread artistically around the room, facing each other and the tables
      alternately. A small hole is in the floor, from which flows a stream of hot air. The furniture is
      covered with transparent material which is coated with a layer of dust. North of you is the entry room,
      and to the east is the pantry.
