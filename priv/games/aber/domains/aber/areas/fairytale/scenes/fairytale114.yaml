    sight: >
      You stand on a railed porch. A glass roof is above you, and you can see clouds drift slowly past. To the
      east you may look down on the trees, which are just below your height. To your south is a large metal
      cube, and to the west is a hallway. Lying around the porch are various pieces of lounge furniture, such
      as a patio chair, a hammock, and a porch swing. This room appears to be a lovely place for a porch
      party.
