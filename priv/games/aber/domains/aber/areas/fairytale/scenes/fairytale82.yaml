    sight: >
      You are standing at the base of a tall tower. Written on the wall, high above you, are the words 'ICBM'.
      The tower itself looks like an ancient version of the missile which you just launched, or perhaps just a
      model of it. To the east is a small door, and all around you is a tall wall.
