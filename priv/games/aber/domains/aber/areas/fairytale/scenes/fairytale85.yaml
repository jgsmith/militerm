    sight: >
      A staircase descends here to the base of the tower which you now stand in. A tall, full-length mirror
      leans against the wall, and a window faces out to the cliffs below. The mirror has been perfectly
      carved, and reflects your image perfectly. You hear a rustling sound behind you.
