      As you step into the room, the stench that quickly enters your nose makes you cringe. When you have
      adjusted to the smell as best you can, you take a look at your surroundings. To the north appears to be
      some sort of laboratory or torture chamber, you're not quite sure. To the south and west are closed
      doors, possibly locked. From behind the door to the west you hear some sort of scratching.
