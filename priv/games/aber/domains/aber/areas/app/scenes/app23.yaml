      You are in what appears to be the main hall of this fortress. Numerous apprentices are scattered at
      tables, studying the art of magic. Other apprentices are in groups talking with each other. As you try
      to look through the exits, guards block your view, stating, "No apprentices allowed through here." Guess
      you have nowhere else to go here.
