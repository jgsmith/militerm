    sight: >
      Before you lies the Dead Woods. From rumors you have heard, very few have entered and have exited
      without being changed in some way. Those who have exited are so frightened by what they have seen, they
      cannot describe it to others. To the west lies a small shack. While to the south, you may enter the
      woods.
