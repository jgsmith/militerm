      The prisoners within this room look like they haven't been fed for a long time. Many of them barely move
      when you enter. From the looks of it, you won't be able to save them right now. You can only hope to
      save them by killing the dark mage. In the corner of the room, bodies of the dead prisoners have been
      piled up and left there to rot. The most recent body looks like one of the mages from the Tower of
      Sorcery.
