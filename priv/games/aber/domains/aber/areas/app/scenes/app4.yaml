      The mages laboratory is filled with glass beakers and flasks. Some filled with mysterious liquids. To
      one side of the wall, cages are stacked on top of each other, containing various small animals. As you
      take your second step, a voice in your head screams, "We did not invite you in this tower to explore! We
      have warned you, now you must face the consequences!" A bolt of lightning appears out of nowhere and
      strikes you. Though you are sure it hit you, you felt no jolt of pain. As you take a look at yourself to
      make sure, you notice a long elongated nose with whiskers, and furry paws. You seem to have been turned
      into a mouse. As you take a look at your surroundings, you are picked up by the tail and put into one of
      the cages. Here you wait for whatever horrible fate awaits you.
