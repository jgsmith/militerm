    sight: >
      You are at the southern end of the valley. The trees continue north, east and west from here, but to the
      south everything ends in a huge black cliff, which soars high up above you at close to vertical for
      several hundred feet. On its top your eyes seem to catch the flicker of something glittering. A narrow
      rocky crack leads south down the narrowing gap between the cliffs.
