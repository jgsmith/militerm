    sight: >
      You stand on the edge of the forest, which extends south east and west as far as you can see. To the
      north the trees give way to a grassy hill. A narrow worn path leads north up the hill. To the south the
      path through the forest is almost blocked by thick hedges, but a few gaps enable you to squeeze through.
