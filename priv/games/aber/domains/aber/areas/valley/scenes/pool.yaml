    sight: >
      You are standing beside a small, smooth pool, fed from a stream which runs in from the north. The cool
      shallow waters of the pool flicker and dance with the breeze, reflecting the swaying trees, and the tiny
      dark specks of the thousands of insects which dart back and forth around you. Paths lead through the
      forest in all directions from here.
