    short: Oak Forest
    sight: >
      You are walking through well spaced oak trees, whose low tangled branches reach out around you,
      confusing the light and rustling quietly in the wind. The forest extends in all direction save from the
      north, where it stops abruptly, cut short by a massive towering cliff. To the west there seems to be a
      clearing. A path climbs up the cliff side to the north.
