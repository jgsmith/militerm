    short: North End Of Valley
    sight: >
      You are at the northern end of a steep mountainous valley. The valley extends away southward as far as
      you can see, flanked on each side by the mighty mountain peaks towering into the clouds. A narrow gully
      leads west up the side of a cliff, climbing at a dangerous looking angle towards the top.
