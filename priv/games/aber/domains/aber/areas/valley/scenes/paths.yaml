    short: Rocky Paths Winding Down
    sight: >
      You are following a rocky path winding down southward into a narrow, steep- sided valley. To the west,
      not far away, a huge citadel is set on the mountain top. The path you are on runs past it, heading up
      into the higher ground among the lower peaks of this range.
