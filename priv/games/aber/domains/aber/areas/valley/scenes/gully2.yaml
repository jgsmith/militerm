    short: Narrow Gully
    sight: >
      You are clambering through a narrow rocky gully, the floor of which is sloping at an angle of almost 45
      degrees. Shale and loose stone make the gully treacherous, as your feet send bits of rock tumbling down
      into the valley below. You can clamber up the gully towards a turning or down towards the valley floor.
