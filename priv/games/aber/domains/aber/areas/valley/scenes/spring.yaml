    sight: >
      You are standing in a small rocky hollow on the edge of the western mountains. A single spring trickles
      from the rock here, running eastwards out into the valley proper. Apart from east back into the valley,
      steep rocky cliffs bar all exits, save west along a narrow ledge.
