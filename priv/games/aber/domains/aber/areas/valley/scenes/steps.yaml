    short: The Cliff Steps
    sight: >
      You are standing on a set of narrow winding steps carved into the side of a steep cliff face. The steps
      descend down as far as you can see, and contemplating them for a long time leaves you feeling giddy. The
      steps lead upwards to the lip of the cliff. To the east, but well beyond your jumping ability you can
      see a wide ledge and what appears to be a cave mouth.
