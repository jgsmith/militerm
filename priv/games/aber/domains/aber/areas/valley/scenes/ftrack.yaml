    short: Forest Track
    sight: >
      You are following a track which leads north through the forest towards a humpbacked bridge. The track
      seems to form here from a myriad of tiny trails which lead in all directions through the trees. A wide
      paved path winds up a huge mound set amongst the trees. On the top of the mound you can make out a
      temple of some sort.
