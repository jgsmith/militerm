    short: Northern End Of Valley
    sight: >
      You are near the northern end of the valley. The dark mountains close up around you to the north,
      although a narrow track for some reason leads north right towards the very end of the valley. Elsewhere
      around you the view is obscured by trees, although from the south you can hear the musical tinkle of
      water.
