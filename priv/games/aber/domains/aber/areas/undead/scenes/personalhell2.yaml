      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. Suddenly you realize it is you &+Rat your prime, and what fine specimen. You watch
      as you groom yourself in &+Ra large mirror taking time to make sure you look you best. You watch as
      &+Ryou slowly age, wrinkles appear on your beautiful face, you stoop with age &+Rand the passion dies
      from your eyes. This is not you, you will never get old.
