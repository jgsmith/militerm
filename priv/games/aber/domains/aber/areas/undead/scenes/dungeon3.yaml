    sight: >
      At the base of the stairs you pause...momentarily taken aback by the sight that confronts you. You stand
      on the precipice of a sea of molten lava. This huge cavern stretches for as far as the eye can see. From
      the ceiling of the cavern, hundreds of feet above, huge stalactites hang as they have for aeons
      threatening to crush the unwary adventurer. Lava spits and bubbles from all around, desperate to share
      with you its warm embrace. To your &+Ceast&* a rickety wooden bridge spans the lava, although it sways
      alarmingly if you hold on tight and move quickly you should be safe.
