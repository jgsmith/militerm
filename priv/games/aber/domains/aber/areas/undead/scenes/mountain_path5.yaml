    sight: >
      The sun shines brightly, the birds sing joyfully, little squirrels run around doing what little
      squirrels do. It is very beautiful here. You feel relaxed as you bask in the eternal evening
      &+Ysunshine&*. You watch as the odd bumblebee flits amongst the flowers. When you finally manage to tear
      your eyes away from the wonders around you, you notice the path goes both &+Cup&* and &+Cdown&* from
      here.
