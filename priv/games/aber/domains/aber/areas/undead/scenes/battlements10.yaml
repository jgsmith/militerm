    short: Upon the battlements
    sight: >
      You stand upon the ice covered battlements. It is incredibly cold here. Solid ice has formed everywhere.
      You slide around precariously holding onto the castle wall to prevent you sliding off. An ice covered
      wall in front of you bars any further progress. Your skin is freezing as the cold chills you to the
      bone, and ice starts to form on your armor. The battlements continue to your &+Csouth&*, however there
      appears no way to get your footing. You desperately lunge and slide around, but there appears no way to
      move..............
