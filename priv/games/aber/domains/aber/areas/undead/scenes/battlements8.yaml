    sight: >
      You stand upon the battlements. It has suddenly become very cold here. Ice has formed beneath your feet,
      and you have to be very careful not to slip. The wind still blows quietly into your face, and yet there
      is no sound. Your skin is chilled as the cold quickly penetrates your armor. The battlements continue to
      both the &+Cnorth&* and the &+Csouth&*.
