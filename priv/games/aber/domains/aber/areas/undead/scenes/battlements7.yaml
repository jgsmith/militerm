    sight: >
      You stand at a turn in the battlements, to your &+Cnorth&* the battlements continue while to your east
      seems to be a way to descend back to the courtyard. Despite their hollow drawn out sound, you are
      grateful for the sound of your own footsteps here. You also notice that it is starting to get incredibly
      cold here despite the gentle wind in your face......strange.
