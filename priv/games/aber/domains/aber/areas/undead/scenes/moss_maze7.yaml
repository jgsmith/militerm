    sight: >
      You wade blindly through the mist. You break through the mist and breathe a sigh of relief. The mist
      seems to end. You are in a sunny clearing, walls of mist surround you. As you start to get your bearings
      a hideous scream is heard and shapes charge at you from the mist.
