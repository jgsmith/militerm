      &+RAll that you are is here, your very soul laid bare, your jealousy, &+Rvanity, sloth, cowardice are
      all here and more...everything that holds you &+Rback, all you fight against and pretend does not exist.
      All your &+Rinsecurity and weakness are here for you to see, all you have lost, all &+Rthe dreams of
      what you may possess all clamour for attention, for they are &+Rall the centre of your own personal
      hell.
