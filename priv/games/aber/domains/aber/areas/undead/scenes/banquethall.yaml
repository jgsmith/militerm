    short: Banquet Hall
    sight: >
      As you enter the banquet hall you can almost hear the ghostly remnants of laughter from happier times.
      There must have been fine banquets here. Although the decoration is somewhat sparse, the hall is huge
      and must measure some 500 foot square. A large oak &+Btable&* runs in a square around the hall, enough
      to sit at least 200 people with room to spare. To your &+Cnorth&* there emanates incredible heat, and
      you think you may be able to hear movement. To your &+Ceast&* and &+Cwest&* are small arched doorways
      which lead of further into the castle. To your &+Csouth&* lies the entrance to the castle.
