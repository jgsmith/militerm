    sight: >
      You stand upon the battlements, from here you can overlook both the desolate courtyard, and look out
      over the surrounding land. It takes you just a moment to realize that something is very wrong
      here.....no sound. There should be wind at this height, but despite feeling the wind gently caressing
      your face there is no sound but your own shallow footsteps. The battlements continue to the &+Cwest&*,
      and a large set of stone steps lead down.
