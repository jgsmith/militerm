      It would appear the Undead King has a particular passion for inflicting both emotional and physical
      damage to his prisoners. This holding cell sits on the very edge of the lava. The sound of spitting lava
      is constant, hot cinders scorch you constantly and the heat is unbearable. There is no other way off
      this holding pen other than to the &+Csouth&* as thousands of the faceless victims have found out to
      their own cost.
