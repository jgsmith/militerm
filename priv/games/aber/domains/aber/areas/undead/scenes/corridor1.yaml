    sight: >
      The hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you enter this room. Surely once it was a grand
      sight. Suits of armor and richly decorated paintings line the walls, but they are all frozen over and of
      little worth. Stalactites hang from the ceiling and ice encrusts everything. There is something
      unnatural about this sight, as from the &+Cnorth&* a great heat emanates, yet still here you are cold.
      To the &+Csouth&* lies the courtyard.
