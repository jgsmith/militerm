    sight: >
      You stand upon the battlements. It is very cold here. Solid ice has formed beneath your feet, and you
      slide around precariously holding onto the castle wall to prevent you sliding off. Your skin starts to
      freeze as the cold quickly penetrates your armor. The battlements continue to both the &+Cnorth&* and
      the &+Csouth&*.
