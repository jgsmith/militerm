    short: Island of sacrifice
    sight: >
      This island sits right in the centre of the molten lava. All round you the lava spits and hisses
      demanding a sacrifice. Over many thousands of years words of great power have been spoken here, as the
      Undead King threw his victims into the endless sea of lava. As you stand wondering what could posses
      anyone to such evil deeds, countless numbers of piteous souls swarm around you screaming at you, through
      the endless corridors of time, demanding you provide their redemption.
