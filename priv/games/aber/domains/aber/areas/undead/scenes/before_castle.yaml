    sight: >
      You finally emerge from the mist and find yourself staring at a magnificent castle. The sun glints
      brightly off gold coloured tiles on the towers. Whoever lives here obviously has way too much money -
      maybe you should relieve them of some of it. The only problem is a moat surrounding the entire castle.
