    sight: >
      You stand at the western side of the courtyard. Above you the battlements runs &+Cnorth&* and
      &+Csouth&*, as the cobblestones continue in the same direction the silence is becoming deafening. Even
      the moss between the cobblestones seems to be turning black and giving up its struggle for life. You are
      starting to feel a little uncomfortable here, and decide to get moving...
