      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. You look in on yourself as if &+Rfrom a long way away, you watch as you admire
      them from afar, so in love; &+Rif you just had the chance. You are not sure maybe they will like you,
      &+Rmaybe they wont. Your heart misses a beat, it is in your past; you will &+Rnever know now.
