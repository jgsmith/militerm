      You stand at the zenith of the mountain. You look out and can see the whole world laid out in miniature.
      The wind wanders gently through the grass and whispers of past heros. Several large trees grow tall and
      there seems little trouble in supporting life here. At the top of the world, as you may expect, the only
      way is &+Cdown&*.
