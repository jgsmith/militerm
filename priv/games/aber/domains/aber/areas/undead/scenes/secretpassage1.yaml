    sight: >
      You stand in a large damp passageway that heads off &+Cnorth&* into darkness. To the &+Cwest&* lies the
      Grand Library. Somewhat damp, the only remarkable feature of this passageway is just how big it is, it
      is almost as though it has been designed to ensure something BIG fits in it.
