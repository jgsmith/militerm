      &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind &+Rworks frantically to
      explain what you see. You watch yourself a younger &+Ryou, a wiser you out to conquer the world with all
      the you knew. But then &+Ryou remember they were there weren't they? They were just so perfect, &+Rthey
      kept getting everything that by right you knew should have been &+Ryours. You know they did not deserve
      what was yours, even if others &+Rdon't. That is all that matters.
