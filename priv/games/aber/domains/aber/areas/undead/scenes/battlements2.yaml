    sight: >
      You stand at a turn in the battlements. To your &+Cnorth&* the battlements continue while to your
      &+Cwest&* seems to be a way to descend back to the courtyard. Despite their hollow drawn out sound, you
      are grateful for the sound of your own footsteps here. You also notice that it is starting to get
      incredibly cold here despite the gentle wind in your face.
