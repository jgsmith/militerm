    short: Entrance to castle
    sight: >
      You stand at the entrance to the castle proper, shrouded in total silence. You wonder if this is really
      worth the effort. Through another large portcullis you see a dark foreboding corridor. Around you the
      world seems to wait quietly watching for your next move. The courtyard continues to the &+Ceast&*,
      &+Cwest&* and &+Csouth&*.
