    sight: >
      You stand at the southwestern corner of the courtyard. The silence is becoming deafening and you pray
      for the clash of metal against bone, to at least relieve the silence. A large set of stone steps rises
      from the floor up onto the battlements, although they are too high to see what may be at their summit.
      To your &+Cnorth&* and &+Ceast&* the relentless cobbles of the courtyard continue.
