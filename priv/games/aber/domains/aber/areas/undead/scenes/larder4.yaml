    sight: >
      You a the far end of the larder, it is dank and dark, not the ideal place to keep food. &+BDust&* has
      settled over everything, and from the walls come the sounds of tiny bony feet. To the &+Cnorth&* and
      &+Csouth&* the larder continues, to the &+Ceast&* you can return to the larder entrance.
