    short: The Grand Library
    sight: >
      This once grand library is a sight to behold. It has one single &+Bbookcase&* the entire length of the
      &+Ceastern&* wall, which must hold literally thousands of books in various languages. If you had time
      (which you don't!) it would take you thousands of years to digest all the information stored in this
      room. Scattered around the room are several small reading tables, but it appears from the dust
      everywhere that they have not been used in many a year. Above you a arched glass ceiling lights the room
      with brilliant sunlight, a refreshing change from the rest of the castle. A handsome mahogony &+Bdesk&*
      catches your eye.
