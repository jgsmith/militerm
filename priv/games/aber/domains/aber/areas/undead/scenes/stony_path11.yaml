    sight: >
      You continue walking behind the castle. Mountains loom ominously to the &+Cnorth&* and the granite wall
      beyond the moat looks just as impassable as ever. You may be able to cross the moat here if you could
      jump a mere 500 feet. The path continues &+Ceast&* and &+Cwest&* from here.
