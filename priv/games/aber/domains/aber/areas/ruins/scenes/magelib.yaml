      This is an ancient library full of shelves and shelves of many books. The room is lit by a magical
      sphere of light that is hovering in the middle of the ceiling, it's dancing white light grabbing your
      attention. Just being in this room seems to make you feel more magically refreshed. Looking to the west,
      you notice another lit room.
