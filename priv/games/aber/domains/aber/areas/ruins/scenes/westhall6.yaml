      You are now travelling north in the hallway. The shrieks are getting louder and more nervewracking as
      you continue forward. You look to the east and west and find that there are what appear to be small
      rooms with ragged curtains partially covering the entryways. You start to wonder if this area could have
      been a guest area of some sort. The hallway leads to the north and the south.
