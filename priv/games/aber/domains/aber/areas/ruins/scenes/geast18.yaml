    sight: >
      You are in the northeastern corridor of a large catacomb. You hear loud rustlings from the rooms around
      you and wonder what can be causing all of the noise which makes you a little nervous. As your foot sinks
      into a pool of blood your nerves start to snap and you hold back a shriek. After you regain your senses
      you look around for exits and see them to the east and to the west.
