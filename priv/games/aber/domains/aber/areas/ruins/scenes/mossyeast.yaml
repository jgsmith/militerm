    sight: >
      You are disgusted as your feet sink deep into the moss with a thick layer of goo underneath it. You feet
      slip and slide around in the goo and you find yourself having troubles standing up. Everytime you almost
      fall over the stench of the goo forces you to regain your balance and steady yourself again. You can see
      yet another mossy room to the east of here.
