      You have entered the Mage's private study room. You hope that he will not be upset that you have entered
      his dwelling or disturb his peace. You approach him quietly and humbly. His desk is cluttered with
      several ancient and modern scrolls and tablets of wisdom and he is thoughtfully examining them. You
      notice that his shelves are full of several spellbooks and magical items of all sorts. You would attempt
      to take something, but feel that it would not be right. As you move closer, the mage turns around and
      smiles at you.
