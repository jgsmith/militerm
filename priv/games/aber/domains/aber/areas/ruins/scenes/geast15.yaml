    sight: >
      You are in the southeastern corner of a large catacomb. Looking around the dimly lit room you feel a
      shiver of fear go up and down your spine as you see a complete skeleton hanging on the northern wall.
      You pray that you are almost out of this evil place. The corridor leads to the north and to the west.
