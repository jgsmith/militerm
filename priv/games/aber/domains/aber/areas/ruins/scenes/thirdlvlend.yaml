    short: A Room
    sight: >
      This room is quite unusual. It is warm and welcoming unlike the rest of the catacombs. You also seem to
      feel your strength replenishing faster as if some God is watching over you. You decide that it would be
      a good idea to rest here for a few minutes. You then look to the east and notice that the wall seems to
      shimmer and blur in and out with pink sparkles. You look closer at the wall and you see what appears to
      be a room much like one that you were in on the first level of these ruins.
