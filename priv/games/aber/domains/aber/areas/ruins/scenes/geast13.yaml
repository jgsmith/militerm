    sight: >
      You are in the southern corridor of a large catacomb. A chilling breeze rips through you and you shiver
      uncontrollably as you look around this area. The catacomb continues to the east and west and there is a
      door to a room to the south. To the south you hear whispers of the past speaking of great pain and
      suffering. It is a very dark room, and you can't see anything inside of it. A sudden gust of wind brings
      the smell of decaying flesh to your nose. You don't think it would be a good idea to go that way.
