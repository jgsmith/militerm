    sight: >
      You are in the western corridor of a large catacomb. Old torn banners hang from the eastern wall and
      they seem to almost dance and sway in the chilling breeze that keeps whistling through the rooms. You
      shiver from the cold breeze and warm your hands by rubbing them together. You notice a door to a room to
      the west and the corridor seems to continue to the south and to the north.
