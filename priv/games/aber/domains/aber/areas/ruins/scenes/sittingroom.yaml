    short: A Small Room
    sight: >
      This is a small room that resembles a sitting room. A few decaying chairs are scattered around the room
      and a small oak table rests in the middle of the room. There is even a fireplace set into the eastern
      wall with a finely crafted marble hearth. Perhaps you should take a few minutes to sit and relax in
      here.
