      You are now travelling north in the hallway. The shrieks are starting to really get on your nerves and
      you find yourself starting to clench your fists. You look ahead into the darkness and once again swear
      that you see a light of some sort dancing before you. You blink your eyes. The light that was there
      seems to have disappeared. The hallway leads to the north and to the south.
