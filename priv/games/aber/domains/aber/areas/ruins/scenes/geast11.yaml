    sight: >
      You are in the southern corner of a large catacomb. There are small pools of blood on the floor and deep
      scratches in the walls. By the looks of the scratches you suspect that they were caused by a sword being
      swung at someone, or something, and missing. Looking at the deep scratches again you also suspect that
      whoever, or whatever, was swinging a sword around is quite powerful. The corridor leads up to the north,
      and seems to lead to the east.
