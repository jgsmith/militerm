    sight: >
      You have entered the eastern catacombs. Your foot sinks into a large pool of goo, or so you think is goo
      until you look down and see it's dark red tinge and a large shiver of fear runs up your spine. There is
      also a foul odor of rotting meat and you feel your stomach begin to turn. Looking around quickly you
      find that there is only an exit to the west.
