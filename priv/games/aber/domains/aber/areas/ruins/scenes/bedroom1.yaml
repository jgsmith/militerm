    short: A Small Room
    sight: >
      This is a small room that looks like it was once a bedroom. There is a bed in the room. Actually, the
      bed is nothing more then the wooden frame that once held the luxurious bedding that was once on it. You
      look around this drab area and wonder when it was last occupied before leaving it unoccupied yet again.
