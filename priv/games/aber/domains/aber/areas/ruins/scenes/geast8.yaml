    sight: >
      You are in the northwestern corridor of a large catacomb. The walls are a total crimson color as are the
      ceiling and the floor. This room is not putting your already nervous mind at rest. The sounds of
      crunching bone fill this whole catacomb and you swallow hard as you shiver from the cold. The corridor
      leads to the east and to the west.
