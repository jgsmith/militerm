    short: End of Northern Catacombs
    sight: >
      This looks to be the end of the northern catacombs. Looking around you wonder why this area is so small,
      it should be larger. You notice an old burned out torch hanging on the west wall with moss growing from
      it. There is also a great deal of moss growing on the ceiling and the other walls and there is yet more
      slime on the floor.
