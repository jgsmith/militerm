    sight: >
      You are in the eastern corridor of a large catacomb. Old torn banners hang from the western wall and
      they seem to almost dance and sway in the chilling breeze that keeps whistling through the rooms. You
      shiver from the cold breeze and warm your hands by rubbing them together. You notice a door to a room to
      the east and the corridor seems to continue to the south and to the north.
