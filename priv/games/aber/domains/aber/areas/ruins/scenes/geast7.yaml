    short: A Large Catacomb
    sight: >
      You have entered into a very large catacomb. It looks to be made up of several large rooms that actually
      look quite luxurious. You figure that at one time, or another, someone of great importance had lived in
      this area. The catacomb continues to the east and west. To the south you hear whispers of the past
      speaking of great pain and suffering. It is a very dark room, and you can't see anything inside of it. A
      sudden gust of wind brings the smell of decaying flesh to your nose. You don't think it would be a good
      idea to go that way.
