    sight: >
      Your eyes slowly adjust to the level of darkness under the protective shade of the arch. To the north is
      a great &+Cmarble&* door, which seems to be the best way to get inside the temple. "Why the heck to I
      want to go in there ?", you think to yourself. You shrug your shoulders and suddenly get the feeling
      that you are being watched.
