    sight: >
      You are travelling across a great &+Ggrassy&* field. The wind blows softly, causing the ripe ends of the
      grass stalks to bob lazily back and forth. To the &+Gnorth&* you spy what appears to be some sort of
      temple, its great white walls blazing with the light of the sun.
