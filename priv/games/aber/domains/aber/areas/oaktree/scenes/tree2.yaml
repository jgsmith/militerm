    sight: >
      You are high up, near the crest of the oak tree. You can see the branches of an elm tree to the north,
      almost touching the oak. Farther away, the tops of the trees thin out into little terraced fields
      propped by stone walls, and groves dark with olive trees and walnuts. In the distance is the sea where a
      boat is idly sailing.
