    sight: >
      In the ilex, deep in the thickest press of leaves, you find a hanging pavilion with curtains flapping in
      the wind, shaded by a large, fringed parasol. Stuck on the branches here and there are fluttering
      ribbons and scraps of lace. Butterflies dart in pairs among the curtains.
