    short: Sunny Clearing
    sight: >
      You find yourself in a large clearing amongst the trees. The sun shines brightly throughout the trees
      here. One particularly intense sunbeam shines upon a large rock near the northern end of the clearing.
      At the southern end you can make out neatly trimmed hedge rows, while a narrow path snakes through the
      clearing from east to west. A sloping hole has been dug out of the earth.
