    sight: >
      You are in an elm tree, high above the ground. This is not an easy tree to move about on as the branches
      grow upwards, slender and thickly covered, leaving little foothold. To the north you can see the twisted
      shape of a fig tree, to your west is a knobby walnut, and to your east is a mulberry. In the south are
      the oaks, haughty and detached.
