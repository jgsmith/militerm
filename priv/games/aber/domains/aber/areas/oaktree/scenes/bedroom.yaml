      This looks like a little girl's bedroom. An arched doorway leads east. The room is beautifully furnished
      with curtains of white taffeta, a Persian carpet, and a tiny canopied bed with cushions of pale yellow
      damask. Rosewood chairs surround a tiny silver table, with a doll's tea service set for two.
