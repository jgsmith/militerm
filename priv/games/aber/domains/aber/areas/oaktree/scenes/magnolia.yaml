    sight: >
      The branches, although they are slender and of soft wood, bear your weight, and the points of your shoes
      tear white wounds on the black bark. You are enveloped in the fresh scent of leaves, turned this way and
      that by the wind, dull one moment and glittering the next. Quite far below the lowest branch is a
      mysterious garden, and to the east, a half-hidden mansion. One high window is quite near your tree.
