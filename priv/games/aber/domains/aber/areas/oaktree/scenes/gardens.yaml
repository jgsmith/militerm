    sight: >
      In the gardens the branches spread out above you like the tentacles of extraordinary animals, and the
      plants on the ground open up stars of fretted leaves like the green skins of reptiles, and wave feathery
      yellow bamboos with a rustle like paper. A white flight of stairs leads east to the mansion. Above you
      is a sweet-scented magnolia tree, but the lowest branch is too high for you to reach.
