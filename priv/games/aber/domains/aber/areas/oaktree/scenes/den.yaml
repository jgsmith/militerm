    sight: >
      You are wedged into a reeking fox den. Strangely enough, the vixen has built her den adjoining a huge
      natural cavern that extends deep into the earth, much farther than your feeble flame can penetrate. It
      looks like it might go all the way to China! You could jump in, but you would fall a long way.... There
      is a blinking construction sign here.
