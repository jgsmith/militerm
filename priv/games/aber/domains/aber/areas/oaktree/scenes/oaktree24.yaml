    sight: >
      You are in a cramped underground tunnel. A myriad of roots dangling from the ceiling keep you from
      standing up straight. From the northern end of the tunnel, light streams down a low incline, dimly
      illuminating the tunnel. It feels as though someone is tapping you on your shoulder, but when you turn
      around no one is there.
