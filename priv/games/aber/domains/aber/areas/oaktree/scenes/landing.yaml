    sight: >
      You are standing in a great pool of colored light, cast by the stained glass of a vast coat of arms in a
      south-facing window, depicting an heraldic leopard. To your west is an arched doorwary. A huge, curving
      marble staircase extends downwards into the mansion, past paintings and stern-looking busts. You have an
      uncontrollable desire to slide down a banister.
