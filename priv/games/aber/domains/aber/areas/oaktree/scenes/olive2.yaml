    sight: >
      This tree is hung all over with scrawled pieces of paper and bits of cardboard with maxims from Seneca
      and Shaftesbury, and with various objects: clusters of feathers, church candles, crowns of leaves,
      women's corsets, pistols, scales, tied to each other in a certain order, the significance of which has
      been lost. The olive grove continues to the east.
