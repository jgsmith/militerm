      You are in an old and stately nut tree. At the fork of the trunk is a hollow, formed from an old ax
      wound. A soft boarskin is stretched across the hollow, making a cosy refuge in the shade of the dark
      green foliage. In a deep incision in the bark, now so old and deformed that it no longer seems the work
      of human hands, is carved in big letters: Cosimo, Viola, and beneath: Ottimo Massimo.
