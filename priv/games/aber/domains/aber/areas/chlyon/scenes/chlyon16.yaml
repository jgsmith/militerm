    sight: >
      You can't help but admire the beautiful craftmanship that has gone into building this hallway. The walls
      are covered with an ivory-like material, and are ornated with ancients runes and symbols whose meaning
      has been lost along the years. One of them you recognize though: The symbol of the people of Thyreen,
      the warriors who have pledged their lives to serving the ancient dark gods of Chlyon, before they were
      overthrown. According to the legend, the current gods of the land were impressed with the courage the
      Thyreeneans displayed in battle and spared their lives with the condition that they will dedicate their
      lives to making sure the legendary beast Chimera will never again be unleashed on the lands of Chlyon.
      To the south, the hallway leads off into what seems to be a throne room.
