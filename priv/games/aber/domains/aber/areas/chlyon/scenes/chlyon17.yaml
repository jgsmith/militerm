    short: The Thyreenean Throne Room
    sight: >
      Even more beautiful than the hallway, this room is lavishly decorated with lively tapestry and
      paintings. A small door leads off to the west, and the hallway is back to the north. A majestic throne
      dominates the southern wall. Above the throne, an inscription declares: 		 "One god alone of all we
      loved. 		We'll never have a changing heart."
