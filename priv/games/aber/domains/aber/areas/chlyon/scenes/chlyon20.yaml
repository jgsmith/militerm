      The mythical Thyreenean forge stands before you. According to legend, it was created by the old god of
      fire for the Thyreenean craftsmen to create weapons for the gods themselves. Some of those weapons have
      now found their way in mortal hands. Maybe.. just maybe.. if the legends are true.. you could forge your
      own great weapon!
