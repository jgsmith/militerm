    sight: >
      A number of paths branch off from here. To the north, a well travelled roads leads off toward a city of
      some sorts. To the west, a small path meanders into the mountains towards a large entryway carved in
      stone. Eastwards, you may attempt to follow a narrow path into the thick forest. Somewhere in the
      distance you hear a volcano erupting. There is a blinking construction sign here.
