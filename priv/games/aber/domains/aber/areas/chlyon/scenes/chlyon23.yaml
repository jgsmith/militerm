    short: Windy Clearing
    sight: >
      You stand atop of a windy clearing on top of the mountain. The view is breathtaking. In the distance you
      can see the city of Themiscyra, and somewhere in the distance a dark castle with a black tower reigns
      atop of a mountain peak. A path windes down to the east from here.
