    short: A Small Grove
    sight: >
      You are standing at a peaceful grove, surrounded by those evergrowing trees and various flowers which
      all look so beautiful, but also somewhat sad. There is a large ant hill, and as a contrast to the grove
      it nearly swarms life. A faint track leads to the north, and to the west there lies a ditch.
