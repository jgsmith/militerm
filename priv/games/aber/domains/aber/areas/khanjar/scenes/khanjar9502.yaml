    short: The Yard Of The Tavern
    sight: >
      This is a large yard growing plenty of grass and a few high bushes here and there. The paving leads
      straight toward the tavern, but there is also a faint trail to the west. This could be a place to have
      fun, at least some voices of singing are heard from inside the building.
