    sight: >
      You are standing at a grass-covered yard. Just to the west lies what may have been an inn of some kind
      years ago. Now its roof and many of the other wooden parts are mostly gone, and the greyish walls break
      off so badly that you somewhat wonder how the building still stands. An open doorway gives passage
      inside. To the north lies an old pen.
