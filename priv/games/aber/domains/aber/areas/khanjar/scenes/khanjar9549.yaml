    short: Before An Ancient Poplar
    sight: >
      You are standing at a grove. Just before you is a large poplar, which foliage spreads in every direction
      like a gigantic green ball. Its trunk is gnarled and carries the scars of hundreds of years. A small
      hole appears to penetrate into the pith of the tree.
