      The space is a small, round chamber, lit by an extraordinary chandelier made of the rhizome of a tree
      standing above there. All around lie small pieces of furniture, most of which you probably could not
      use, for they are rather tiny. However, they are skillfully constructed, revealing both the artistic and
      practical abilities of whoever was the maker. A thick, multicolorous carpet covers the floor. To the
      west is a small, wooden door.
