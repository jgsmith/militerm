    short: An Ancient Crater
    sight: >
      You find yourself standing at a vast and deep pit, obviously an ancient crater with a diameter of 30
      metres, at least. The bottom is covered in brownish grass and there are several rough boulders around,
      most of them black. Also you notice that the crater is full of small folk, everyone directing towards a
      structure of some kind further away to the east.
