    sight: >
      As you reach the marshland, the clouds of insects catch you in their unpleasant embrace, penetrating
      your very equipment. You move on quickly, over the damp hummocks and over the small pools of black
      disgusting water, to escape those tiny winged beasts. Further away to the north seems to be an another
      hillside, growing high trees. Remainders of a bridge-like structure still lie here, leading across the
      marsh.
