      The air in this room is musty, and it smells of hard liquor. On the floor there lie a bundle of creased
      clothes and a couple of muddy shoes. As you step toward the window you notice that the floor there is
      sticky and covered in thousands of tiny glass fragments all around. Obviously there has been a festival
      of some kind in the City at last night.
