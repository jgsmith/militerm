    sight: >
      The dais has been grinded very smooth. Four green pictures cover its surface, representing fine trees.
      Each picture points to the sepa- rate cardinal direction. In the middle of the dais stands a tall,
      wooden &+Cstatue&*, resembling an impressive woman, clad in clothes made of large leaves and garments.
      The brownies assemble to the foot of the dais and you feel the atmosphere running high.
