      As soon as you enter, you notice the craftmanship it must have taken to make this room what it is. There
      is a tree with gold leaves growing from it. Porceline maidens dance around the base, placing food
      everywhere they can think of. The exits are &+Cnorth&+C, &+Csouth&* and &+Ceast&*.
