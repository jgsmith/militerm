      If this was Mother Hubbard's pantry, it would be about as bare as this one. It has old crumbs of bread
      that represent where pieces of bread used to be. There is one of those old buttermakers here. Eww, as
      you look inside it you see rats eating the butter. The exit is to the &+Ceast&*.
