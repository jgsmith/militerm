      This is the place where all the bad people in the castle go. There are various types of whips and chains
      hanging on the wall. Some of them have metal straps on them with little steel balls. There is a torture
      device here that pulls a person's hands off from his body. Obviously it hasn't been cleaned because you
      see some bones still stuck in it. The exit is to the &+Cwest&*, and that's it.
