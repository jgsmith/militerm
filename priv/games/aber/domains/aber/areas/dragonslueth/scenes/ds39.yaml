      Ahh Ha!!! You found it! Here it all lies - the throne, his books and records, everything! The throne is
      gold with silver bands inlaid with rubies in the legs. The crown glitters and sparkles, catching your
      eye. The room itself is very small and looks like it has been dug very quickly. The exit is to the
      &+Ceast&* and that is the only one that you can find.
