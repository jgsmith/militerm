    sight: >
      The ground of the cave begins to grow colder until it is completely covered with yellow snow. You decide
      not to investigate this phenomena any further. The room is very big compared to any that you have
      previously seen and the stench in this room is unbearable. You can't believe you can stand the smell.
      The cave continues to the north, south, and east.
