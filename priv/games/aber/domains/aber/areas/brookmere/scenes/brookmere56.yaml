    sight: >
      Walking up the stairs, you at are at first eager to see what is at the top and hurry along. But after a
      long time going up, you decide that whatever is at the top is not worth the time and start to make your
      way back down. However, after an equally long time you are still not back in the room in which you
      started. You start to run down the stairs, striving to reach the bottom, but to no avail. The stairs
      just go down, or up, and around and around without going anywhere.
