    short: Dungeon Treasure Room
    sight: >
      Despite the room being heavily fortified, with thick stone walls and door, there is no treasure here -
      not the usual kind anyway. This is where the goblins and gnolls are supposed to store any treasure or
      unusual objects they find in Brookmere. The generals check this room on their rounds every week, in case
      there is something `dangerous' that needs to be taken away for further examination. Of course, the
      goblins and gnolls know what the really means and keep anything they find under their pillows or in
      their lockers instead. This room has instead become a makeshift casino, where any hobgoblin might stake
      their wages on a game of blackjack or gin rummy. Its treasures are the dice and the cards scattered
      around on the floor.
