    short: Gaping Hole
    sight: >
      The hole lies in the shadow of the hulking remains of Brookmere's watchtower. It looks quite old, as
      various grasses and weeds have sprung up around the rim, obscuring any exposed digging work. The hole
      leads down into the dungeons that the orcs, goblins and gnolls must have made their home. Peering down
      into the wide, gaping maw you see a rockfall that would take you down to the dungeon level if you are
      careful.
