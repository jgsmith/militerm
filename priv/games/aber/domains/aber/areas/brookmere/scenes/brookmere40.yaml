    short: Wet Corridor
    sight: >
      The black corridor winds on endlessly, down into the earth. Cold and miserable, any flame you had
      reduced to a bluish dot, you struggle on, wet to the waist. Suddenly you are aware of a roaring noise
      that must have been with you down the whole corridor. The tunnel ends suddenly, and you realise the
      water in the corridor has become quite turbulent. Looking under a nob of rock you find a small &+Chole&*
      underwater, that looks like it leads into an open space. It would be a squeeze, but you think you could
      manage to swim through and get out of the corridor.
