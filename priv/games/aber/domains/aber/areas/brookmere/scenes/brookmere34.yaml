    sight: >
      Plucking up some courage you walk through an opening and stumble into a meeting of all the hobgoblin
      generals and officers! Horrified you turn to flee before you are seen. Alas, your foot slips on a smooth
      rock and you fall, letting out a loud cry, rolling to a stop in the middle of the crowd of hobgoblins.
      Shaking your head to clear it you see three large, well-armed orcs surrounding you. Chuckling evilly
      they pick you up, tie you securely, throw you over their shoulders and walk off into the gloom. Always
      trust your intuition....
