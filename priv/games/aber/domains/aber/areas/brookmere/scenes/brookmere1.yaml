    short: Ruinous Forest Edge
    sight: >
      You stop at the edge of a forest that once ringed a castle and stare in disbelief. The only thing that
      still stands is the broken shell of a tower. All else is ruins. Scattered across the ground are enormous
      piles of boulders and chunks of masonry. Carved on one such boulder you spy the word 'Brookmere'. This
      then must have been the great elven castle of Brookmere, or at least it was until it was invaded by the
      orcs, goblins and gnolls from the surrounding lands, forcing the elves to flee. The most noticeable
      feature on the ruined landscape is a wide black hole in the area of the castle that once seems to have
      housed the dungeons of Brookmere.
