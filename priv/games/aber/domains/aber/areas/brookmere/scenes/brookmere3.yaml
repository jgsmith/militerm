      It appears that at some point part of the hole above collapsed, creating a landslide of earth and rocks
      from the ruin. This is what you are know gingerly climbing. Far above you, you can see a faint light and
      the rim of the hole. Below, you can make out the dim outline of a passageway leading into the gloom.
