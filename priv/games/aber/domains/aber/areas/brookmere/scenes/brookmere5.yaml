    short: The Elves of Brookmere
    sight: >
      Emerging from the ruins you at first squint in the bright sunlight after having been underground so
      long. When your eyes have adjusted you look around. Elves in construction hats scurry about
      investigating the ruins, while nearby in the shelter of the trees you can see the outskirts of an elven
      campsite, with elf children playing up in the trees. The elves have returned to Brookmere to start anew!
      Already you notice scaffolding being erected at the far side of the ruin and stone masons trundling
      blocks of stone around in wheelbarrows. Turning, you look down into the crater that used to harbour the
      dungeons of Brookmere. You can still see the white block of marble that transported you to the alarm
      room. Almost unconsiously you kick a stone over the edge of the crater. It bounces down, dislodging more
      stones and rocks as it goes, until it becomes apparent you have started a landslide. The whole thing
      lands at the bottom making a lot of noise, and when the dust clears the white block is obscured. The
      elves look toward the crater briefly, then return to their errands. No-one seems to have noticed the
      mortal who climbed out of the ruin. Oh well, you are just glad that things have been restored to their
      rightful order in the world.
