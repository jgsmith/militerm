    sight: >
      This room is much like the tunnels you have just passed through, only this room has smoke stains on the
      roof and torches spaced evenly along the walls in metal holders. Not all of them are lit and those that
      are are of different types; some are new and green, some old and splintery, some blackend and burnt down
      to almost nothing. There are doors to both the north and south. There is another, larger room to the
      west.
