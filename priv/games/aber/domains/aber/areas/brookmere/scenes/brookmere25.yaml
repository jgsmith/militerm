    sight: >
      This must be the gnoll guard room, it's so neat and tidy. Helmets hung up, swords put away in the
      cupboard, dinner cleared off the table and no smell whatsoever. In fact, the only untidy thing about the
      room is the &+Cbulletin &+Cboard&*, which is crammed with notices and messages.
