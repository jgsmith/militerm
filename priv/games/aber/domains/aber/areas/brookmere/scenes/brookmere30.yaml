    sight: >
      You stride boldly into the room - and then stagger back clutching your throat. This room needs a good
      dusting! The place is choked with the stuff and nearly choked you along with it. A thick grey fog
      seethes around the room, particles glowing when they come in reach of your light. The &+ydust&* is so
      thick you cannot see a metre in front of you. Vague shapes here and there indicate furniture of some
      sort, but aside from that and what is inside your circle of light, you can see nothing.
