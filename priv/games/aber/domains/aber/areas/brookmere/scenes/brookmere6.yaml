    sight: >
      You are standing at the edge of a forest that once ringed a castle. The only thing that still stands now
      is the broken shell of a tower - all else is ruins - but all that is soon set to change. Elves in
      construction hats stride industriously all over the ruins and scaffolding is already being constructed
      around the remnants of the tower. Scattered across the ground are enormous piles of boulders and chunks
      of masonry. Carved on one such boulder you spy the word 'Brookmere'. The famous Brookmere castle was at
      one time was occupied by orcs, goblins and gnolls from the surrounding lands, but they have been
      destroyed and now Brookmere's rightful inhabitants are busy rebuilding their home. You decide not to
      intrude on them.
