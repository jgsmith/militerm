      Apart from a rough-hewn workbench and an empty glass-fronted cabinet on one wall, the workroom of
      Orobius looks empty. Only a fool would believe it is really empty though; Orobius would have hidden his
      secret work before he left Brookmere with a blanket illusion. Behind the door though, you find a small
      &+Cblock of white marble&*, just big enough to support a person or elf, standing between four white
      marble pillars.
