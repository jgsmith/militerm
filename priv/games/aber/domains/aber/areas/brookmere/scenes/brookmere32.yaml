    sight: >
      This room is fairly nondescript - in fact, it's completely bare. But it is not only bare of any
      furniture or objects, even the walls, the ceiling and the floor don't look all there. They look
      very..well, they are indescribable, apart from being very forgettable. Only by staring hard at the wall
      does it look solid and real. Otherwise they hover at the edge of your perephiral vision looking vague
      when you try to see them. Fleetingly you think you see the &+Cfigure&* of a seated person out of the
      corner of your eye, but the image quickly seuges into nothingness. The room makes you uneasy. It is so
      forgettable you are in danger of forgetting where you are. Better leave quickly.
