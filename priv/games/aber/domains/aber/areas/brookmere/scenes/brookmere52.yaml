    short: Throne Room of Orobius
    sight: >
      The only thing in the entire room is a large white marble throne, shot through with black, set up on a
      dais. However, when you walk towards it to get a closer look you end up on the other side of the room.
      When you turn around and try again the same thing happens - you just can't get to it. You walk up and
      down the room for some time trying to examine the throne, getting increasingly frustrated, until you
      find the trick of walking directly away from the throne, which gets you right up onto the dais. Looking
      at the back of the throne you find a silver plaque with the words `Throne of Orobius, Master
      Illuisionist and Enchanter' and some runes below that probably say the same thing. This room then
      belonged to the great Orobius, Master Illusionist of Brookmere, purveyor of illusions of sight, hearing,
      sound, smell and taste. To the east is a doorway leading to what looks like the Masters workroom -
      unless, of course, it is an illusion.
