    sight: >
      Grasping the shimmering doorway, you place your head and upper half of your body in the misty clouds and
      try to see what lies ahead. For a minute nothing happens, then slowly the upper half of your body begins
      to glow and shimmer with unearthly light, spreading down to the rest of you. The glow fades, taking with
      it your features and colour. The outline of your body can still be seen but it starts to smudge and
      blur. Soon, all that is left is white, billowing smoke moving gently in the quiet corridor, then
      drifting through the door and becoming part of the larger cloud mass. You have tried to pass through a
      door of nothingness, which no mortal may do and live.
