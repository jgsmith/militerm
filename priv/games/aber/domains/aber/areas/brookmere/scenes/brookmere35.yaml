    short: Smooth Corridor
    sight: >
      Stepping out into the corridor you find that there is no need to put a second foot down as you are
      sliding along the floor on one foot! The floor is so smooth and polished that the gentlest push will
      send you from one end of the corridor to the other. Gliding along you see a wall &+Changing&* that you
      would very much like to examine, but when you put your hand to a wall to stop yourself your fingers slip
      right off! The only thing you can grab hold of is the doorway of what looks like a supply room. From
      here you can take a proper look at the room at the other end of the corridor, or turn back and go the
      other way. Looking through the doorway of the room at the west end of the corridor you can see steps
      leading down. To the east is a smooth door.
