    short: Dusty Corridor
    sight: >
      This corridor is a lot less dusty than the room to the north, although it could still do with a good
      clean. Tapestries on the walls are obscured by a mantle of cobwebs and dust has piled up in drifts along
      the wall. With each step you take a gray cloud erupts under your foot and dust gets into your nose,
      making you sneeze. To the west you can see an open doorway, and something flashes in the dark.
