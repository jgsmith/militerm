    short: Cobwebbed Corridor
    sight: >
      Usually the odd cobweb doesn't faze you at all, but walking down this corridor you can't help but cringe
      a little from the hundreds of cobwebs that look like they are holding the place together. They plaster
      the walls, hang in tatters from the ceiling and are stitched across every corner. With every breath or
      breeze that escapes you the webs shiver ominously, a signal to their occupants. You can only hope they
      decide to ignore you.
