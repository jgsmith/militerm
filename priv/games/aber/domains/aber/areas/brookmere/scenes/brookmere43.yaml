    short: Smallish Tunnel
    sight: >
      This tunnel must be a squeeze to the orcs and goblins currently occupying Brookmere, but it is still
      bigger than average for you. It looks very old, being built of unshaped stone boulders, with &+Gmoss&*
      and other things that don't need much light growing in the cracks. The tunnel climbs upwards to the
      north, while another good sized tunnel branches off west. To the south you can hear sounds of moving
      water.
