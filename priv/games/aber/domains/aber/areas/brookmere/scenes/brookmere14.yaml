    sight: >
      You are now in a large room where it looks as if a battle has taken place recently. The wall on the far
      side of the room shows great destruction. Most of the stonework has fallen into the room. Large boulders
      lie scattered about the floor and the earthen wall is braced with a crisscross of metal plates held in
      place by massive wooden beams. Furniture has been thrown about and a great mantle has been thrown down
      from the fireplace. What on earth happened here?
