    sight: >
      This is the beginning of a straight corridor that leads south to a large room. The corridor continues
      onto the north. The corridor was obviously damaged in the invasion and has been crudely repaired by the
      invaders. Masonry is propped up with beams and poles, some of which are bending under the strain, and
      the flagstone floor is very lumpy and uneven, like an unmade bed. You shake your head at the hobgoblins
      pathetic attempt to render the corridor even serviceable and sigh, remembering the skill of the elves.
