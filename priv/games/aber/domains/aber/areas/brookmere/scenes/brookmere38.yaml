    short: Damp Corridor
    sight: >
      Judging from this corridor you are nearing some body of water. The walls feel cold and damp, even more
      so than is usual underground, and water drips through the ceiling in numerous places, collecting in just
      as many puddles. A light breeze blows from the west and brings with it the smell of water and earth. The
      corridor continues on to the wetter west and back to the dryer north.
