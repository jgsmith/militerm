    sight: >
      Cautiously you enter the room, lit only by the soft glow of a candle, and stifle a gasp as you see the
      huddled forms of a dozen or more gnolls! Then, observing that they are all lying horizontally on bunks,
      you relax, realising they are asleep. Gnolls love a snooze, at any time of the day or night, and never
      miss a chance to catch forty winks. All is still, but for the quiet breathing of the sleepers, the rise
      and fall of their chests under the covers and the flame of the solitary candle melting in a sconce.
      There is nothing of interest here. You can probably leave without waking anyone if you tiptoe.
