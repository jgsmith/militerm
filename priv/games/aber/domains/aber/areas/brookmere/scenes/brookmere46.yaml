      This must be where the orcs store all their loot - The room is filled with &+ychests&* in various states
      of decay, with tarnished plaques and ragged labels saying things like ` MOORGS FINGS' and ` PERSUNAL N
      PRIVAT' . You try all the chests eagerly (you little thief!) and find that, much to your dismay, all of
      them require a key and cannot be bypassed by your lockpicking skills.
