      This room is full of oversized swords, scabbards, shields and other implements of war, belonging to the
      orcs. There are bottles of lard on a shelf in the back and bunches of chain hung on a hook for cleaning
      sword blades, but they don't look like they have been used very often, all the sword blades you can see
      being encrusted with something dark and congealed. Unfortunately everything in here is way too big for
      you to use.
