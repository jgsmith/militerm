    sight: >
      This is where the goblins hang out when not on duty - the goblin guard headquarters if you will, with a
      &+Cbulletin board&* hung up behind the door for goblin related messages. The place looks and smells
      absolutely disgusting. The goblins must be in the habit of simply throwing everything on the floor when
      they have finished with it. Mouldy food spews out of a cupboard, grubby tunics in lumps on the floor are
      decaying like piles of rotten fruit, several goblin swords have been slung into a corner uncleaned of
      any blood or guts that might still be on them and on the table among the remnants of a recent dinner is
      a &+Cshield&* which has obviously been used as a plate.
