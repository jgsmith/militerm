    sight: >
      Standing on a silty shoreline you gaze up in awe at a huge waterfall plummeting down from on high. The
      spray arcs out in all directions, making the cavern walls glisten and filling the air with a fine mist.
      The noise is incredible, amplified by the acoustics of the cavern, making any conversation save a yell
      impossible. The waterfall cascades into a circular pool, beaten white and frothy by the force of the
      water. The pool overflows on one side, letting the water race on into an underground river to the east.
      On the other side of the pool you think you see a small jagged hole leading into darkness, but there is
      no way you could reach it from this side of the waterfall.
