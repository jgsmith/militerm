    sight: >
      Stepping off the marble block you look around quizzically at your new surroundings. You are in a small,
      bare stone room, with light coming from somewhere far above. Raising your eyes skyward you discern that
      you are gazing up the middle of a very long square spiral staircase, though you can't see what is at the
      top. The bottom step lurks in the shadows to your right, but you are daunted by the height of the stairs
      and decide against attempting to climb them. Behind you is a &+Cblock of marble&*, identical to the one
      in Orobius' workroom, that you suppose would take you back there if you stood on it.
