    sight: >
      As you draw closer to the end of the corridor you see a light. The light comes from a strange doorway
      set in the stone wall of the passageway. The doorway glows with the brightness of sun on snow, making
      everything around you dark. Thick white clouds puff and roll between the door frames. Stray whips reach
      out toward you, beckoning you to see what is beyond the door. Will you follow the footprints?
