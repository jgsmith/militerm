    sight: >
      You are in a small ruined room, one that must have been wrecked when Brookmere was invaded. The stone
      walls and ceiling have been taken away to fortify other parts of the dungeon, so bare earth, threaded
      through with the roots of weeds on the surface, is all that remains. The green glow is especially bright
      here after the dimness of the corridor. The source of the glow is an archway at the far end of the room,
      dripping with a glowing green fungus. A bitter smell like rotting mushrooms fills your nostrils. Slowly,
      small pieces of the fungus break off and fall to the floor where they collect in a shimmering pool.
