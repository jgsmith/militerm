    short: Alcove
    sight: >
      An ordinary old indentation in the main corridor, about a metre deep, traditionally used to display
      large objects tastefully that would otherwise block traffic - except that there isn't any `object d'art'
      being displayed here. There is only the &+Rbrick wall&* at the back of the alcove, which looks a bit out
      of place compared to the stone walls surrounding it.
