    short: Common Room
    sight: >
      This room is, in theory, where gnolls and goblins can hang out and `get to know each other'. In practice
      the room is divided by an invisible line into gnoll and goblin territory, and no-one crosses the border.
      Other than that, the room is quite inviting, with a large fireplace generating lots of heat, stools
      arranged into groups conducive to a nice chat and the faint smell of amber liquid wafting about.
