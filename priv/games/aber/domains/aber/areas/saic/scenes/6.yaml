    sight: >
      You just passed through a hole in the ceiling. You are now standing in a wide room. Everything is made
      of stone around you. Some &+Rred&* fluid is leaking from the ceiling. West of here seems to be a very
      &+Cpowerful&* room. The cave continues to the east and to the west.
