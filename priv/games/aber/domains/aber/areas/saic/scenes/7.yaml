    sight: >
      This is the room of absolute power. In fact, it is the room of ultimate power because Cresso made it
      this way. Do you know how much courage it takes to write a zone when you don't feel like it? So don't
      say anything if you see weird things like this room. It is absolutely meaningless. Well, not really.
      Players will wonder what reside in this room. Nobody must tell them. Oh, by the way, what is the meaning
      of life?
