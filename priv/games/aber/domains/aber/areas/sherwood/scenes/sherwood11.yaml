    sight: >
      You are standing under oak trees. You look up to admire their beauty. When a passing European Swallow
      flys by and defacates on your face, you frantically look around for a sink to wash your face, when you
      suddenly realize that you are in sherwood forest. I guess you will have to walk around with bird feces
      on your face.
