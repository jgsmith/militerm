    short: Rainbow Waterfall
    sight: >
      You are standing in a small stream just below a breath-taking waterfall. The spray off the falls causes
      a beautiful rainbow to stretch across the river. You can not imagine a more beautiful place. Jagged
      rocks cover the bed of the stream just below the falls. The stones become smoother and polished further
      down stream from the continuous wearing of the water. The grass is short, soft, and green, perfect for a
      picnic with your sweatheart.
