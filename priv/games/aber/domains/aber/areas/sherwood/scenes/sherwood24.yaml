      You have reached yet another turn in the road. The trees grow dense to the west. They are ominous and
      block all sunlight from reaching the ground. You stand here trying to muster up the courage to venture
      on. You look toward the trees and a shiver runs up your spine. You know that if you continue. There is
      no coming back. It is all or nothing. What are you a man or mouse?
