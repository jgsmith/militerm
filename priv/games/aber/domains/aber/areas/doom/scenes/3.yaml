    short: &+cA Wooden Shack
    sight: >
      This shack appears to have not been used in a long time. You notice that it is very messy and has a
      strong musty smell to it. There is a table in the middle of the room that has scraps of old cut up fish
      on it. On the east wall is an old rocking chair, the chair looks unused and has collected a lot of dust.
      There are a lot of cracks in the ceiling and walls, letting dim, diffuse light into the room.
