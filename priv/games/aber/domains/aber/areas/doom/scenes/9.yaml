    sight: >
      You enter a path in the woods. It is dark and very creepy. You can barely see the path, only enough to
      know where to put your feet. You feel like you're being watched and looking around you realize the trees
      have horrible faces carved on them. The path leads to the east where there is a little more light, and
      to the south where it passes a large shack.
