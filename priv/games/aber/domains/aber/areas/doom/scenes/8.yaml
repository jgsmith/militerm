      You walk into a large bar. This seems to be where most of the people are, for the bar is very crowded.
      There are people sitting at tables having drinks, talking, and people dancing on the dance floor. There
      are a bunch of drunks on the stage trying to dance, but they are stumbling and laughing too hard to do
      so. You notice one guy sitting at the bar by himself with a strange look on his face, maybe you should
      talk to him.
