    sight: >
      You are standing at the entrance to a small town. There are a lot of old shacks around you, although
      many of them are not standing anymore. You notice a pleasant-looking shack to the west; is doesn't look
      as dirty as the rest of the shacks that are still standing. To the north you see that the forest closes
      back in on the town, while to the south you can see a gate in the distance.
