    sight: >
      The forest to the north looks very thick and dark. The road you are standing on is narrower here than to
      the south, and it gets even narrower to the north. The dirt here looks like ashes, and there is a smell
      in the air of rotting flesh. There is a large shack to the east or you can go north or south on the town
      road.
