    sight: >
      You are on a road that leads to the north and south through a lifeless forest. You notice the flowers on
      the side of the road are dead and seem to have been trampled on. To the north you can see a town and
      notice that there are no houses, but little huts instead. You can see that a lot of the huts have been
      burned down or are damaged as if there had been a fire here. The road leads north to the town, or south
      to a large and heavy set of gates that lead through a long wall. To the east you see a small wooden
      shack through the trees.
