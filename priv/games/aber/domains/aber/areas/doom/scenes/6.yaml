      You are in a large and nicely maintained yard which appears to be the nicest place in town that you have
      seen. There is a small pond set in the middle of the yard, with arranged groupings of flowers and bushes
      that surround giant trees. You hear the sounds of birds and other animals here that you have noticed to
      be absent elsewhere in the forest. This is the only nice place in town that you have seen so far. To the
      east you can enter the shack.
