    sight: >
      You are walking along a soft, sandy path that has recently been covered with animal tracks. On either
      side of the path large trees and undergrowth smother the ground with roots and leaves. In the distance
      the sound of rushing water catches your attention. To the north there is a small hill of rock. You can
      go south or continue onward through the jungle by going west along the path.
