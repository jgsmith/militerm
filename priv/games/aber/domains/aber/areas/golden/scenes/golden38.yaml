      Making your way past the giant bronze door, you stand in a ancient, sacred treasury. The floor is made
      of small silver and platinum tiles patterned like a checkerboard. Thick carved pillars of solid jade
      line a red carpet which runs straight up a set of stairs toward a marble statue of a grinning monkey
      sitting on its haunches. Lying scattered on the floor are gold coins, emeralds, rubies, and diamonds for
      the taking. Golden gargoyles peer at you from the ceiling. The ceiling has a large, finely crafted ruby
      set in the middle. Fountains molded from pure crystal hide behind the pillars, gushing forth tiny
      diamonds.
