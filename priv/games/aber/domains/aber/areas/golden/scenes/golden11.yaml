    sight: >
      You have discovered a small village that is nestled deep in the jungle. There are a few natives doing
      their daily chores, not even noticing you. A large fire crackles in the center of this village. There
      are small animals running around the huts with children chasing after them. To the east there is a
      small, clay well that looks like it has dried up.
