    sight: >
      You are standing in a room that has not been used in quite a while. Dry leaves swirl around the floor as
      many pairs of red eyes stare at you from cracks in the walls. There are old, faded paintings on the
      walls depicting lost and won battles and days of famine and disease. To the east there is a small side
      room while to the north and west there are corridors.
