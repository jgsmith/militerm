    short: Cave behind the Waterfall
    sight: >
      This cave has been carved out from the powerful force of rushing water. The walls are smooth, damp, and
      patches of moss cling everywhere. Heavy mist hangs about this cave, making it slippery. The glitter of
      diamonds embedded in the walls catches your attention.
