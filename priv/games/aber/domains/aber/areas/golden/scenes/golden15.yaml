    sight: >
      You are walking along a trail that runs by a vibrant, crystal-clear pool of water that is fed by a
      rushing waterfall. Looking down from the trail, you can see colorful and strange fish floating about in
      the water. A small path leads down to the bank of this pool where you could take a dip if you want to.
      Straining your eyes, you can barely make out a niche behind the waterfall.
