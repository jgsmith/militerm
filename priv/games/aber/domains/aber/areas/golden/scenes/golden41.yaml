      You are standing in a small chamber. All around you big and small stars leap at you and it seems like
      you could touch them. The are many voices talking and whispering as if some sort of conversation was
      taking place. There is no floor needed here, for you are being suspended by some unknown force. There is
      a mystical fog swirling and rotating around a small gateway to another land.
