    sight: >
      Teetering on the brink of death, you step back. There is a huge gorge directly in front of you, with no
      way to cross it by foot. You notice the tree branches that intertwine above the gorge. You think to
      yourself that you could easily climb the trees and walk across the branches to reach the other side.
      Easier said than done.
