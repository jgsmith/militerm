      This was once a beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable &+Bbed&* and a small &+Btable&* at the eastern
      wall. There are some closets in here but they have been raided by someone...someone that didn't care
      much of doors apparently, course a few of them have been torn apart or the doors have been smashed to
      tiny pieces!
