    sight: >
      This room is comfortably furnished with a small bed, a table and some chairs. It almost looks like a
      prison cell, just more comfortable. This is the room that the butler has prepared for his master, and a
      good job it is. This is the kind of room you would like to have if you were locked away for a long time.
