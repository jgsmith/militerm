    sight: >
      A wide avenue of crystalline cobblestones leads down the heart of this plaza, circling a fountain of
      incredible artistic talent and branching at that junction. Two small square edifices stand at the far
      corners of the courtyard, made of solid crystal. There is a deep thrum coming from that direction,
      vibrating the entire courtyard slightly.
