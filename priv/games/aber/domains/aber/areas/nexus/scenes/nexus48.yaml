      At 150 feet above the eroding rocks, the grassy tops of the cliffs rise to a tapering point. Tropical
      birds fly at these lower altitudes, gliding on the coastal breezes. Close to the edge, an ancinet
      &+Cbrick cairn&* stands for no apparent useful reason. On its top tier lies a small, wooden idol - an
      artifact to some long-lost deity, perhaps. The grass around the cairn grows more steadily compared to
      the rest of the plateau, where the weather continually gnaws away at the nutrients in the soil.
