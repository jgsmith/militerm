    sight: >
      The trees form a full canopy, completely blocking out the sun. Only a few dim streams reflecting around
      allow the unaided eye to penetrate the otherwise darkened interior of this forest. Branches form at odd
      angles and threaten to poke the aforementioned eye out of an unsuspecting traveler. There are numerous
      lichen lining the bark of the trees, eagerly breathing in the natural essence of the forest. Tranquility
      is the order of the day as a quiet wind whistles through the tree tops.
