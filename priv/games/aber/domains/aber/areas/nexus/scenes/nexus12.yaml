    short: Castle Gates
    sight: >
      Frozen, white, crysalline statues of former rulers in bold poses cross their stern gazes at the
      staircase, daring any of those who wish entry to the castle to prove their worth. The gates themselves
      are lines with a velvet coating and adorned with brass buttons, where each button is forged under deep
      heat and emblazoned with this castle's coat-of-arms. The walls of the castle are extremely tall and
      sheer, appearing to be almpst made out of the same material as that of the far-below pain. Any attempt
      by besiegers to scale the castle would end in hundreds of broken bones.
