    sight: >
      The beach extends to the west and north &*from here; the northern cliffs fading into the distance. The
      tide washes in a line to the south, but a curious turn of nature has arisen to the east. There the water
      is extremely shallow, and the sea bottom rises up to form a long sandbar.
