    short: Island Beach
    sight: >
      The beach narrows here; the sea coming close to the island's greenery. The sea bottom also begins to
      plunge down at a faster pace, and the waves are higher. To the south the beach opens up into a wide
      expanse, while the north cardinal features the entrance to a trail.
