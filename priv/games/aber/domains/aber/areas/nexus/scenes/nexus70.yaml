      Someone has used this huge chamber as a junkyard for millenia, given the amount of antique items in
      here. There is not much gold, silver, or jewelrey, but one cabinet has a thousand small jars in it. The
      souls of all those captured by the demons of the Plane of Torture fly around endlessly in these
      encapsulated places, suffering as much astral agony as they do physical.
