    sight: >
      The fog is much less dense here than to the southwest and southeast. It allows more bright, yellow
      sunlight in, revealing the thin outlines of the cloud castles above. The wind has picked up
      considerably, driving the fog swirls faster and in tighter circles. To the north the plain continues as
      far as the can see.
