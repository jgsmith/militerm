    sight: >
      A flat trail leads up a slight slope towards the center of the island, looking recently trailblazed.
      Shde is provided often from the gigantic fronds of the natural vegetation. On many leaves there are
      small holes where bugs have eaten and empty cocoons where the rare tropical caterpillar has undergone
      its usual metamorphosis into a multi-hued butterfly.
