    short: Island Beach
    sight: >
      The southern portion of the beach approaches a plateau atop the cliffs. A hundred feet below, the sea is
      much more unforgiving than to the northwest. High, frothy waves smash with heavy impact against the
      jagged, volcanic rock below, forcing the sea anemonies and many critter to crawl into the porous rock
      surfaces for shelter. Survival in this evironment has been rather scarce since the beginning of time due
      to the harsh conditions.
