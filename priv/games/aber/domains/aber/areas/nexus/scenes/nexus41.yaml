    sight: >
      The shoreline is crammed full of foamy wtaer, which has brought and dumped over the aeons a rather
      tremendous amount of floatable debris. Empty shells of crab, lobster, and mussel, rotting driftwood, and
      numerous species of seaweed lay strewn at irregular intervals. Not all is dead slowly petrifying,
      however, as twitchy movements in the shadows reveal the locations of some hidden nests of those who
      dwell in this intertidal zone. The usual sweet and salt smell of the sea is coupled with the screeches
      of the gulls as they zoom overhead on the sea breeze.
