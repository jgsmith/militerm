    short: Groove in Some Rock
    sight: >
      This is a deep depression in the side of the rock, situated on the leeward side. The smoothness and
      cuvature of the groove suggests that the effects of erosion have occurred more slowly than usual, as
      there are no signs of cracks or water leakage. Some droppings and bones lay inside the fissure, awaiting
      the old ally of decomposition - time.
