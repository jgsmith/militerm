    short: Magma Pond
    sight: >
      The mad haze of red is all around with intermittent flashes of bright yellow flame. Magma swirls around
      in a slow circle, always kindling the destructive potential here as a sort of undeniable threat to
      surface dwellers. The bottom of the pond is made out of frozen and compressed adamantium, the one known
      material which can resist any levels of heat save that of the sun itself. A stunning building made of
      the same material lies before one side of the pond, booming ominously upwards into the redness of the
      pond.
