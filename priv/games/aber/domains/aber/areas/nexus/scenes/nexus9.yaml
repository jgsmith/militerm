      Sunlight drives away the gloomy fog, showing the cloud castles in all their splendid glory. They are
      quite close now, with the cloud bottoms a dark, fluffy white. A few birds native to the land, namely the
      Aqua Griffins, fly over the castles and land randomly on perches on the tops of towers. More of their
      kind zoom downwards to the ground to catch transparent fish from a stream which slices across the flat
      crystalline ground.
