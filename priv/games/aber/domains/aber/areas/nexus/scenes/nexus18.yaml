      Three makeshift beds line separate walls of this drafty chamber, quite literally rotting away to moldy
      splinters. A tattered knapsack on the ground provides poorly-lit housing to a family of rats. Their
      squeaking matches the frequency at which the incoming wind resonates a burnt-out lantern hanging on a
      hook just inside the door. In one corner, a bucket with insides covered by brown slime sits ensnared by
      a vine that snakes around the room. Behind it, an ugly green lump of decay appears to be the capital of
      the mold civilization in here.
