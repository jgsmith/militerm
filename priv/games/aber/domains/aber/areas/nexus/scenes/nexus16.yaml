      The fountain gurgles with exceptionally clear water and provides some measure of life to this otherwise
      seemingly deserted castle. An intricate structure of mermaids and fish are entwining around the central
      part of the fountain. From the mouths of the fish and the ears of the mermaids pour forth not only
      water, but a deep indigo effervesence which makes the water sizzle and explode into a thousand crystal
      sparks as it strikes the surface of the water. It then proceeds to cause the entire fountain to have
      hundreds of small streams of bubbles float from the the base of the fountain to the top.
