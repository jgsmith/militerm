      The swirling purple fog reveals a solid wall of crystal nearby, the different angles of rocks reflecting
      images of other walls surrounding this area on three sides. This crystal canyon has no major special
      features save that of a mount of white quartz near the back wall. It is of an odd color of white and
      being slowly eroded away by the fog and time. The wind picks up within this canyone as the air currents
      high up above force the air downwards.
