      This is a small room set aside withing the castle walls for the resident gatekeeper of this castle. The
      room is well lit by verious floating globes at out-of-othe-way places. On a rack against one wall is
      displayed the occupant's personal armor and weapons. A small desk in one corner is covered in the daily
      reports and dispatches that constantly flow through this place, but today, not one of the of the
      telegrams has even been opened and read.
