    sight: >
      Nestled in the outside corner of the trail is a broken tree, its trunk crushed and splintered by a
      pounding force that once passed over this area. A small family of foxes, also multi-hued, now live
      inside the devastated tree. The trail leads to the beach to the west and comes to and end to the south.
