    sight: >
      Five hundred feet separate the ground and top of this wall. The wind speed resembles that of the jet
      stream itself, powerfully whipping across the flat width of the top of the wall. On one side there is a
      spectacular view of the island, but on the other, a very dark abyss exists. Even the light of the
      noontime sun cannot make a dent in this bottomless shadow.
