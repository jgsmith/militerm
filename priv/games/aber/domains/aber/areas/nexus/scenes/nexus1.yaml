    short: The Crystal Plain
    sight: >
      The swirling purple mist clears in this region of the plain, allowing visibility to several hundred
      meters. Like the eyes of a hurricane, the sky above is clear as well, giving view to the legions of
      cloud castles above, each floating on its own separate mounds of white fluffiness and ice crystals. A
      soft wind rustles slivers of shattered and reflective crystal along the ground and propels the clouds in
      the same direction. The sunlight that does manage to pierce through the gloom is partly absorbed, partly
      reflected off the plain.
