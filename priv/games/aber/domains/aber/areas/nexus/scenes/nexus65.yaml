    short: Molten Bank
    sight: >
      The rocks closest to the river slowly melt into the river itself. Eventually, the river will encompass
      this whole area and beyond. Part of the bank has collapsed, allowing the flowing magma to fill in the
      resulting crater. It is now filled to the brim and maintained as a sort of bay.
