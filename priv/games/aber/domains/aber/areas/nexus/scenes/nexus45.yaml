    sight: >
      The crosswinds buffet the yard-wide strip of sand, pushing water over the top of it as the waves crest.
      Bits of seaweed and other debris deposit themselves nicely on the path. On either side, the sandy bottom
      slopes gently downward, but the sea here islagoon-like and remains mainly under a fathom deep. Manta
      rays turn their natural camoflauge on in an attempt to hide from the sandbar travelers.
