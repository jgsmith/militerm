    sight: >
      The southern edge of Deufel is protected by a large wall with a heavy iron portcullis allowing travelers
      to enter and exit. This gate is used most often by the Wizards of the White Phoenix, who have a compound
      to the south. Looking around the compound, you find that it doesn't have any entrances. It looks like
      they use magic to move around.
