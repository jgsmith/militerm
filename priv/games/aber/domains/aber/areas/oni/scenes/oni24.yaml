    sight: >
      You stand in a clearing. Before you is what appears to be a very decrepit shrine or temple of some
      forgotten culture. The high walls that surround the shrine has started to crumble in some areas. Through
      the various gaps, you see a one story building with four pillars at the corner. Each pillar is topped
      with a different statue. The building and pillars appear to be in good shape, unlike the wall that
      surrounds it. Even with this fact, it appears that this place has been abandoned for quite some time.
