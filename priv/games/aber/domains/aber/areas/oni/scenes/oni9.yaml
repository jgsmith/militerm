    short: Shore of a Calm River
    sight: >
      You find yourself on the shore of small river. From your position you can make out a tower jutting out
      of the forest to the north. There does not appear to be a path to the north, but you see a well traveled
      path to the east. Looking across the river to the south, you cannot make out anything. The path to the
      west appears to be flooded, and looks impassible at the time.
