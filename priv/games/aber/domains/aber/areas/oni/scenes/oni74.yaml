      The interior of Deufel Temple is lit by large braziers placed at the corners of the room. Also providing
      light are the large stain glass windows depicting various events in the Order of the White Phoenix's
      history. A small alcove to the south provides access to a staircase to the balcony above and to the
      basement.
