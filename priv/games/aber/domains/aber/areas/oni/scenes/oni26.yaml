    short: Inside the Temple
    sight: >
      The interior of the temple is larger then one would expect from the outside. Large stone steps lead down
      to a large open area where much of the area is cast in shadow created by the large chandelier hanging
      above. You catch glimpses of movement, but it could be your imagination.
