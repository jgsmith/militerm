    short: Deufel Library
    sight: >
      What makes Deufel Library so special is that it houses the largest collection of material related to
      demons and demon-kind. Much of the information comes from books written by members of the Order of the
      White Phoenix. The rest of the libraries collection isn't shabby either. There are &+Gshelves&* upon
      shelves of books about various subjects on each of the nine floors.
