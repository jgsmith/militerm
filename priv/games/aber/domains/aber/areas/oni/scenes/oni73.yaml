    short: Deufel Temple
    sight: >
      When travelers first see Deufel Temple they are amazed at the beauty. Then they wonder why it is not
      within the town walls. The clerics of Deufel Temple have always felt that walls were not need to protect
      them. Their faith would be enough to protection. Even so, the temple has been destroyed on multiple
      occasions in the past, which results in the current, relatively new, temple.
