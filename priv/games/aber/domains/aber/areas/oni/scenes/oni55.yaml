      The northern end of the hallway opens up to the east. The room to the east is ornately decorated.
      Torches shine down brightly on a huge pool in the center of the room as well as the metal decorations.
      There appears to be something in the middle of the pool, but the bright light makes it difficult to see
      clearly.
