    short: Hidden Forest Path
    sight: >
      You are on a hidden forest path. The path continues further into the forest, but you cannot tell where
      it leads. The sound of rushing water is getting louder. Looking back to the south, you try to make out
      the main path, but you cannot find it in the abundance of shrubs and foliage. There is another path
      heading east here as well.
