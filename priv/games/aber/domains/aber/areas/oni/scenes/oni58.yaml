    sight: >
      You stand at the south end of the large circular pool. Looking into the pool, you find that even with
      all the lights around you, the pool seems to fade into darkness. Floating above the center of the pool
      is a stand holding a full suit of armor so dark that it absorbs the light and a sword that appears to be
      sharp enough to cut through stone. Although the armor and sword is out of reach, you can probably swim
      to it without problems.
