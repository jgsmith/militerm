      You are below the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star in the city of Toran. Torches line the walls of the
      stone block chamber, but no light penetrates the northern archway. Within the arch, the space is truly
      space - a deep black. A large star is tacked on the southern wall in honor of the Brotherhood's
      centuries of service. It is fashioned from several thousand layers of kagonite and bronze metal alloys,
      allowing it to sparkle when the least amount of light shed on it.
