    short: Tree Cave
    sight: >
      The forest enfolds and towers above and beyond you. As if to prove this, an enormous tree juts out
      through a hole in the roof of the cave, complete with its roots buried in the mossy ground here. A
      spiral staircase has been carved into the side of the tree.
