      These are the lower hills of the Durncrags. Herds of deer, rams, and elk are the inhabintants here. They
      roam the yellow-brown oats and grasses for food and exercise, knowing that they have no predators here.
      Their brethren, the mountain goats, face dangers, however, further up into the mountains.
