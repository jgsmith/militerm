    short: The Village of Dage
    sight: >
      On the southern reaches of Sommerlund stands the village of Dage, one of the many such hamlets which
      send its young to the Kai Monastery for training. This village is not exceptionally poor, but it could
      be doing better. It would be if not for the war with the Darklords. A large community well is in the
      middle of the main street, and horse-driven merchant carts head clippity-clop in and out of town. Off to
      one side of the street, a group of children are engrossed in a game of freeze tag.
