      The sun shines down brightly from across the western horizon as it slowly sinks towards the Durncrags.
      It blares right into your eyes and illuminates the tower. The Kai Masters lead their troops of trained
      warriors into the defense of the country from this spot. It offers a breathtaking view of the
      surrounding area and an overview of the festival in the courtyard below.
