      This is the Helgedad ghetto area, where thousands of horrors dwell in ebony black cages. They are "pets"
      of the inhabitants of the city. Pleas for mercy, food, and an end to torment and pain echo forth from
      these city blocks. A cross between a monkey, hippo, and a tree moans loudly in one corner cage, its
      useless eyes staring out of an empty head.
