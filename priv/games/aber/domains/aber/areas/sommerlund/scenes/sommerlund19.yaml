    sight: >
      The forest ground dips toward a narrow, snaking gully. The fast-flowing waters which gust through it
      come from the Durncrag Mountains to the southwest before dumping themselves in the Holmgulf to the east.
      The river is sparkling clear, but interestingly devoid of fish. The forest trees dip their roots into
      the water and eagerly drink from its freshness. This is one spot where swimming is most definitely
      allowed.
