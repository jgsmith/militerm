    sight: >
      The corpses of several animals surround you on all sides. Bones of various shapes and sizes color the
      colorless landscape. Craters and volcanoes litter the area like lesions of the skin, the former
      collecting the fallout of the great pluming clouds of the latter. A lava flow zigs and zags its way
      across the reaches of the wastelands until it intercepts a wide chasm in the distance. Ungodly amounts
      of noxious fumes pour from this wide crack in the earth. Across the chasm, a city composed entirely of
      black steel points jaggedly into the scarlet sky.
