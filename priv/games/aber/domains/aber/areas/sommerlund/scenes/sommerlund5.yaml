    sight: >
      Only a few traces of the nearby desert are here. Those seeking a dry climate and numerous reptilian
      creatures should keep the morning sun on their right. Built out on the edge of the desert lies a small
      city. The faint aroma of barbecued mutton floats on a slight breeze. To the west, the trail continues
      towards farmlands.
