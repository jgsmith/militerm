    short: The Nest
    sight: >
      This is the home of the leader of a dragon herd. The herd has been sent forth by Naar, the King of
      Darkness, to destroy the fertile lands of Sommerlund. The nest itself is made of super-strong fibers,
      interlaced to give it a nice, weaving appearance and strength when being moved. The plateau on which it
      rests is formed of heavily scorched black glassy lava and under high enough heat and pressure to
      transform it into a crystal with a clarity rivalling that of a diamond.
