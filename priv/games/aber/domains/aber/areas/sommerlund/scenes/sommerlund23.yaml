      This is the foyer for the school of the warriors who attend classes here. The Kai Lords are the elite
      warriors of the land, protecting their country from the scourge of the Darklords. Here, the young
      warriors learn battle prowess, history, alchemy, and lore. These tutelages have been broken down into
      thirty parts called 'disciplines.' According to the scenes displayed on the walls here, the warriors
      enter as very young children and emerge as knowing adults. They appear ready to take on the world. The
      northern arch leads to broad daylight while a large group of people have gathered to the south.
