    short: Pass of Moytura
    sight: >
      This is a small pass between low foothills. It is a connection between the desert and the distant
      fertile farmlands. There is a hut off to one side of the pass, looking like it has been derelict for
      centuries. This pass was often a place for thieves and cutthroats to gain riches by ambushing merchants
      who travel to the village to sell their wares. It is possible that this hut was used as a storage
      facility for such purposes.
