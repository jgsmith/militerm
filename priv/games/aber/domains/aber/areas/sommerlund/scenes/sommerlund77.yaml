      The fiery chasm lies just to the south, and a hundred miles of open, pocked wasteland is to the north.
      The constant scarlet glow in the sky is produced by the endless volcanic eruptions within the chasm and
      the lava flow which snakes its way into the chasm. Great clouds of poison gas and intense heat pour
      forth from it.
