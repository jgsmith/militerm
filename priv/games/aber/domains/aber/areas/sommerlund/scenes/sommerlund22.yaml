    short: Before the Monastery
    sight: >
      You stand straight before the massive doors at the entrance to the Monastery. The doors are easily ten
      feet tall and surrounded on either side by two-meter thick whitewashed walls. At the top of the walls
      are several turrets, towers, and cannon implementations. From the great height of the walls, it seems
      the residents of this fortress could easily shrug off any possible attacker. However, the Monastery does
      not seem to be a place of violence, but of learning. Engraved on the doors from top to bottom are
      pictures of books, learning scrolls, and mortarboards. There are also vertical lines, topped by a
      five-way pointed star, running along the hinge sides of the doors.
