      Featureless blocks of steel are piled up on each other to form a small pyramid here. It is an altar of
      worship and sacrifice to the rulers of this dread city and the heat-plastered wastelands outside - the
      Darklords. Several creatures surround the shrine, some shedding their own blood into crystalline
      chalices at specific points along the altar.
