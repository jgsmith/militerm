      Festivities are abundant today! Flyers announcing this year's week-long Fehmarn festival and celebration
      decorate the walls of the courtyard, along with streamers and strung balloons. Flowers are worn by many
      ladies here, and the men take part in drinking, wrestling, and dancing contests. A large wheel has been
      hung on one booth, where the person strapped on the wheel attempts to endure constant circular motion.
      The test, of course, is how long the person can spin without getting completely sick. There are also
      side bets on what color the person's face will be when he or she does get sick.
