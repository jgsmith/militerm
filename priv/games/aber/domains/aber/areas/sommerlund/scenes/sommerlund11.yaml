    sight: >
      Tall trees surround you, but the sun still penetrates. Your feet crackle the twigs and underbrush,
      sending jittery chipmunks and squirrels back to their respective homes. Birds sing out sweet choruses of
      seemingly random chirping as they quaintly build their nests. A fox dashes out of the ground and runs
      past you, in search of a friendly anteater. Its red tail brushes your leg and smacks a tree in its
      haste. The forest grows deeper to the west, where the start of a rocky cave looms proudly from the
      ground. Towards the sea in the east, the forest grows lighter and emerges onto plains of grass.
