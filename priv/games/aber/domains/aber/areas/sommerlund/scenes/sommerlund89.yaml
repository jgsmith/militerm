    sight: >
      You stand on the flat top of a highrise mesa overlooking a misty, snow covered swamp. It stretches to
      the horizon and beyond in all directions. Numerous islands rise above the icy bog, and lone trees occupy
      the very center of each. Every single tree has been torched by the constant rain of lightning issuing
      from the raging storm above you. The stench of death and barbecued bark invades your nose.
