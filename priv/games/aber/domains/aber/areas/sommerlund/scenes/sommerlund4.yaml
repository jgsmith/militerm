      As you push open the decaying straw door of the hut, the door hinges creak and groan. At first glance,
      the hut appears to be nearly empty. There is still the impressions in the dirt left by countless bags of
      silver or gold. A chest in the back of the hut lies filled with old mining equipment, broken and
      useless. Dust lines the shelves on one wall, with a single, empty jar perched defiantly on one. However,
      you see some bedding material in the corner. It is in a state of disarray and slightly coated with dirt,
      but bears every sign of having been recently used.
