    sight: >
      All sorts of boating gear and diving equipment line the walls of this tumbledown shack. The wooden walls
      are dank, musty, and somewhat rotted. Fishing rods and large, empty boat racks are stationed in one
      corner of the room. At one time, this place might have been a shop, but now it lies empty and forgotten.
