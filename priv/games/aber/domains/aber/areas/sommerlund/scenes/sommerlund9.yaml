      The trail becomes a road, and vice versa, at this point. Another road intersects it perpendicularly. To
      the west, the road slips out of the farmlands and enters a forest. To the east, it dips toward a sea. A
      scarecrow hangs on a signpost here, probably a warning to those crows who choose to visit this area.
