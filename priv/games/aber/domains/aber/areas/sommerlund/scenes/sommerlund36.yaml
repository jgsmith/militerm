      The excavation task here must have been enormous. A circular chamber stands twenty feet high with
      pillars depicting the sun. A life-size statue of the sun god Kai stands in one area of the circle. Kai
      Lords come here on 'pilgrimages' to further study their disciplines by meditating in the prescene of
      Kai. A bronze pedestal in the middle of the chamber supports a velveted cushion on which several
      spherical, many-faceted, crystal gems lay in as many indentation inside a glass box. These polished
      rocks are the reknowned lorestones which were reclaimed by Lone Wolf during his quest for the 'Magnakai'
      - the greater disciplines. However, there is a good size crack in the box, and one of the stones seems
      to have fallen out of it.
