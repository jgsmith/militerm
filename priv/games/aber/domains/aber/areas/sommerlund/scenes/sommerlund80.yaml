      Every road and every building is made out of black steel and/or similar alloys. Thousands of exploding
      fireballs and gargoyle torches that produce blue flames are the main sources of light in this dark city.
      The avenues are wide and long, forming an endless chain of sharply cut squares when seen from an aerial
      perspective. Skulls and deadly-looking racks of weaponry line most doorways and windows. There is a
      massive, cloying stench of sulphur and carbon dioxide, and these two compounds account for the heavy
      amounts of acid-rain in the oxygen-killing atmosphere. Slow-moving transports are pulled rythymically
      and mechanically by thick-furred beasts of burden. The drivers of these huge, metal carts wear cloaks,
      capes, and hoods to hide their hideous, orcish features. The pace of the this city is disturbing and
      foreboding - it is truly a place of decay.
