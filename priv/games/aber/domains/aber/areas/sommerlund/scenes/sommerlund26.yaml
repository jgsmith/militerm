      This is the coach of a magician. It has books abound in dealing with lore and arcane incantations. There
      is also a wide variety of alchemy reagents lying in jars on the shelves, as well as a long, silver,
      sleek staff propped against the bed. The walls are lined with runes themselves, perhaps warding off
      something. There is neither an aura of good nor one of evil, but a crystal wand on the table has the
      word 'kai' on it.
