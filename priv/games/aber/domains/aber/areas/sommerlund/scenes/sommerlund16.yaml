      In a small room, you might not expect many things. But in here, there is a huge bed in one corner. A
      dining table for two sits as the centerpiece, and shelves and cabinets line two walls. A sink lies in
      one corner, with the pipe going only god-knows-where. This is not the home of a hermit, but that of a
      well-paid, professional businessman or politician.
