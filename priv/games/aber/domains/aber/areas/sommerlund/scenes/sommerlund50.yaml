      A mist precludes some of the mountain tops. Also, the trees thin out and eventually stop altogether.
      Nearby, a campsite looks as if it was recently used. The fire's embers still glow, and wisps of smoke
      still puff out. The only residents in this part of the Durncrags are Mountain Giaks, a weak and cowardly
      breed of evil thugs.
