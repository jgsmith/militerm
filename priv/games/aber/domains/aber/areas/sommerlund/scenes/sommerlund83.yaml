    sight: >
      A fountain stands in the middle of this wide, open square. Instead of running water, a lava flow courses
      through thr elegantly decorated piece of architecture. A congregation of green and purple robed
      creatures meditate in one corner of the plaza, using chants which send rats fleeing in all directions.
      To the south lies a solid black wall.
