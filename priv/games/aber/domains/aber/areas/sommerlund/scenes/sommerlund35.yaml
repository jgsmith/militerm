    sight: >
      The cold, dark basement is rather well-kept. The floor is practically dust-free, and no cobwebs decorate
      the ceiling or walls. A musty odor is slightly evident in the atmosphere, due to the fact that air
      circulation isn't exactly tip-top in this tower. However, there is an impressive engineering feat set on
      the southern wall.
