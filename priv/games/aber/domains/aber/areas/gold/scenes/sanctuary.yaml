    sight: >
      As you enter the Sanctuary, you stand in absolute amazement at the sights laid out before you. There are
      rows upon rows of pews, on your left and right. As you look up, there appears to be no top to the
      cathedral, and it is open to the skies above you. You can feel the weather from outside, however, it
      does not affect the health of the sanctuary. There is a stairway to the left of the room which appears
      to lead to the altar.
