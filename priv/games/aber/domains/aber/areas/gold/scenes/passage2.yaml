    sight: >
      You are in a North <-> South passageway which runs underground. There are three pictures on the wall in
      this room. The first is of a man with the word NED inscribed on his coat of arms. The second depicts NED
      feeding a needy person who is lying on the ground. The third shows NED battling a mighty warrior with a
      strong weapon and defense. It looks as if there may be a chalice of some sort in the background of the
      painting, though the paint has faded somewhat, and it is hard to tell.
