      You are in another passageway under the ground which travels North and South. The drawings on the walls
      here are of a large table which has been squared off to be The Square Table, as the drawing is titled.
      It has names like Lancelot, Graham and Robin inscribed on it in an order of seating. What looks like the
      Holy Grail is standing in the center of the table, surrounded by never fading flowers! At one end of the
      table must be King Arthur's seat, for painted there is a majestic crown and the sword of glory,
      Excalibur. You suddenly realise that the knights of the square table are no more!
