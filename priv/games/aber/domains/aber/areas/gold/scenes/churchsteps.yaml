    sight: >
      There are two massive doors here. You find it hard to believe that this church is built by people! The
      doors alone are at least 100 feet in height and the church itself towers far above you. There is a large
      cornerstone on the church. You notice it has some kind of lettering on it. The doors are huge oak doors.
