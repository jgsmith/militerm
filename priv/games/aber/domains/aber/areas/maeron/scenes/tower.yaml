    short: &+BThe Tower Of Maeron
    sight: >
      The tower offers you a magnificent view of the land. Off to the southeast you can see a plume of smoke,
      probobly from the crackling fire in the Warm Haven. You are held in awe at the majestic creation of the
      gods. As you reluctantly look down from the beautiful sight, you notice that you can trudge to the edges
      of the towers. They look rather unstable. They also appear to be above some nasty, and very sharp rocks.
      Perhaps Maeron used this tower for his astronomy experiments, or just for the nice view. Anyway, the
      only safe exit appears to be downard.
