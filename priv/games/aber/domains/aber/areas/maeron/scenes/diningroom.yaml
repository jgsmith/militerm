      Grand feasts of Mages were once hosted in this chamber, when mages would come together to share secrets
      with each other. What was once filled with the music of mages is now full of a dark oppressive silence.
      Strangely, the table seems to be missing. You may return &+Reast&* to the foyer, or continue &+Rnorth&*
      to the Kitchen.
