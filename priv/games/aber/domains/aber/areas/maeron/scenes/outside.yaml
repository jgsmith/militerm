      Before you stands the mansion of Maeron. This mansion has been abandoned for years, after the lone Mage
      Maeron died in one of his daring experiments. Many an adventuror has tried to retrieve the treasures
      from his mansion and failed. The mansion's spires twist menacingly skyward, daring you to enter... You
      may boldly head &+Rnorth&* toward the mansion of Maeron or return &+Reast&* to the ravine above the
      cliff window. A sunny path lies to the &+Rwest&* invitingly.
