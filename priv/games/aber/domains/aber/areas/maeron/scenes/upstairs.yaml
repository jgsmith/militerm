      This is a small room right above the staircase that leads off to several other rooms. Icy winds from
      blizzard pass blow from above, through where the roof used to be. To the &+Rnorth&* is Maeron's bedroom,
      to the &+Rwest&*is his library and to the &+Reast&* is another staircase, apparently leading off to a
      tower. You may head &+Rdown&* the spiral staircase into the foyer.
