    sight: >
      This chamber is the foyer of Maeron's mansion. Once beautiful, it has now fallen into disrepair. A thick
      layer of dust seems to cover everything. The fine furniture, once of high quality is now also covered in
      dust and rotting away. To the &+RNorth&* is what looks like a laboratory. &+RWest&* is the dining hall.
      Off &+REast&* is the living room. A wrought-iron spiral staircase leads &+Rdown&* into darkness and
      &+Rup&* into fierce sounding icy winds.
