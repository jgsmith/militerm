      The grassland fades to spotted scrub here, and finally merges into a great line of trees. To the far
      north a stormcloud hangs in the air ominously, but strangely enough it is still quite pleasant out.
      Crickets chirp merrily, and the sun's rays warm your skin. The wagon trail leads eastwards back into the
      grassland, and dissapears westwards into the forest.
