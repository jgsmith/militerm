    sight: >
      You are heading deeper and deeper into a valley. The walls climb up on either side of you, soon becoming
      nearly vertical. Your path is slowed by thick choking vegetation grabbing your boots. The path back to
      the south disappears in darkness, and your path continues to dip as you head to the north.
