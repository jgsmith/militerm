    sight: >
      As you enter this room you get a full realization of how large and intricate the cathedral really is -
      or was. All around you are excrements and vile smelling pools of slime. The pews of the church at ripped
      and beat to small bits of timber and ripped cloth. You begin to notice skeletons and half rotted
      cadavers. There is a stench that is apparently stronger further inside the church. Very little light
      filters in from the broken stained glass windows. There are exits to the south, east, and west. There is
      always the way back to the foyer to the north.
