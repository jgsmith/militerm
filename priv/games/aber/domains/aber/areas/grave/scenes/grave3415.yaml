    sight: >
      The orchard at one time must have been a beautiful, very peaceful place. You might have have come here
      to relax on the well manicured grass, enjoying the majestic oak, pecan, and magnolia trees. However, now
      they are all dead, and decaying branches and stumps litter the ground. The air smells of death - You
      just hope it is not yours. An exit west would be the prudent choice.
