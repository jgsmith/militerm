      Chained in one corner is the priest. As you enter the chains break and the priest slumps to the floor.
      He is very weak and looks as if he would welcome death. He smiles a grim smile at you and you see
      admoration and respect in his eyes. He motions toward the exit and drops a key here. He says to take his
      earthly posessions as he should now go meet his GOD and atone for his failures. He then utters a few
      words and disappears in a fine mist. A deep resonant bell rings - the sound coming from the exit.
