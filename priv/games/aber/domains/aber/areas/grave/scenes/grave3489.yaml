      This room is very nicely decorated. But instead of decorating with equipment of battle this 'devil'
      decorated his with stuffed heads of vanquished foes. Beside each head as before is a note as to name and
      date of death. Another unique thing in this room is the devil. He motions for you to draw your weapons
      and prepare yourself. He truly enjoys a good fight.
