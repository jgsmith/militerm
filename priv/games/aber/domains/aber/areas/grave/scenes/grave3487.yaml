      This room is decorated with weapons, and armor taken in battle and mounted upon the walls. The weapons
      have nicks and the armor is bashed and there are notes by each with the victims name and date of death.
      There are chairs and other furnishings fashionably placed. But what disturbes you is the presence that
      is also here. There is always the exit back east.
