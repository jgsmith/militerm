      You have found the real closet of the priest. On the back wall is a finely crafted cabinet with solid
      glass door. As you look in the &+Cchest&* your heart stops as you realize the value of the equipment the
      priest left behind. You now understand what the invaders were looking for and feel relieved you have
      discovered this treasure first. There is a door to the east.
