    sight: >
      The bottom of the Belltower is here. It is dark, dank, and smells like a sewer here. It is now very
      quiet and you know at one time this room must have lead to a pleasing, musical place that called all
      surrounding Shadowdale patrons to their church. Up is the top of the Belltower and to the west is
      another exit to this now deserted room.
