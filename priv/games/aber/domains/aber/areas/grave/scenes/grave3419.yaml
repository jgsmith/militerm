    sight: >
      The schoolroom has been used and is now decorated with a different kind of religion. The teachings here
      now fill you with dread as you realize the evil things that were once here were learning how to welcome
      YOU to their world of the undead. You grimace and decide you better take the exit south before they
      return to further their education.
