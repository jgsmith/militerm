      Well you've done it now! Along the north wall are two large gaurdians that rush to attack as soon as you
      make your presence known. There are signs of others that have tried as the room is scarred with battle
      marks. There are no signs, however of any that have succeded. Your fight here will be brutal with little
      chance of success. The only exit appears to be east.
