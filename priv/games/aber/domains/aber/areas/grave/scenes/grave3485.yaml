    short: Crack in the Wall
    sight: >
      You have found a crack in the wall just large enough for you to make your way through. As you squeeze
      your way through the sharp rocks poke into your skin making your armor very uncomfortable. Just as you
      leave the tiny crawlspace an earthquake takes place closing off the exit west. You have a distinct
      feeling that this was not a random event. There is now only an exit south.
