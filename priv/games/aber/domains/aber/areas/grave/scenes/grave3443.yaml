    short: The Acolyte Chamber
    sight: >
      Here the acolytes sit until called upon by the priest to help in the services of the church. There are
      collection plates with broken instruments of torture lying about. The floor is stained with blood and
      you see several corpses dressed in solid white robes that have been hacked and stabbed until they died a
      most unpleasent death. The lighting is very dim but you do see what might have killed the underserving
      victims. There are exits east and west.
