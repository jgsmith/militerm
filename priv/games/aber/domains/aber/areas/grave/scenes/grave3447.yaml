    sight: >
      Here is the office of the mighty priest. A desk sits in the middle of the room that has been ransacked.
      There are many books, scrolls, and a few potions lying about the bookcase - all broken and destoyed. The
      invaders were looking for something here and you wonder if they found what they were looking for. There
      is an exit to the east and a door to the west.
