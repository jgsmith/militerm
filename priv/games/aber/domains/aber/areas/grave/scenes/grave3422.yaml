    sight: >
      You struggle to reach this room as it has been a long climb. There is a large bell here, still intact.
      The room amazingly is undamaged and your heartbeat quickens as you realize that there still is a place
      in the church untouched by evil. The windows here overlook the massive orchard that looks like a
      warzone, and beyond you see the graveyard. The feeling of dread returns as you are aware that you must
      past these places to return to your home. Looking closer at the bell you notice the intricate, ornate
      carvings and are overcome with grief at the realization of all the wonderous things in the church that
      must have been destroyed. The only exit is down.
