    sight: >
      You stand before a large altar. The stench is now overpowering but the great destruction that has been
      brought to bear here is even more so. The pews are ripped and charred and the velvet cushions are in
      small shreds and scattered. There are many humanoid corpses that have been stabbed and hacked
      repeatedly. The lighting is faint however you notice a small glow the comes from atop the altar. The
      glow seems to give you hope and you have a strange feeling to move forward toward the altar. There are
      exits north and south.
