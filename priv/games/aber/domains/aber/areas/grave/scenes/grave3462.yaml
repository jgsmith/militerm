    sight: >
      You have arrived at the bottom of a long shaft that slopes sharply up from here. The temperature is
      markedly cooler than the top of the shaft and it feels more humid. There is not a sound to be heard
      except from a drop of water striking the ground every few seconds. As you look around you spot an exit
      to the south or you may be able to climb back up.
