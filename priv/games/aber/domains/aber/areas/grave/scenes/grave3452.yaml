    sight: >
      Here is a large hallway that connects some rooms used to instruct and rally the attackers with a final
      checkpoint beneath the church. To the north is the bank of a large body of water. The floor here is
      smooth and you can tell the hordes that took the church all came this way. The smell here is awful.
      There are exit to the north, south, east, and west.
