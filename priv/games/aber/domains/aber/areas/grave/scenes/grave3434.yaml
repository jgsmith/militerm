      Here is the right side of the massive cathedral. As you have seen before the stained glass windows are
      broken out. You look out the window and see why very little light filters through - the church is
      overgrown with vines and thorn bushes essentially covering all the windows. The smell is strong and you
      wish you were back in the safety of Shadowdale. There is an exit to the west.
