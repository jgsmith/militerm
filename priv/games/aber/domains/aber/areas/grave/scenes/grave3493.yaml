      In the center of this room is a large table with many chairs pulled up close. On the table are maps,
      troop strenghts, chain of command, etc., all the details of waging war on something - or someone. On one
      wall is a large banner which reads in large print ... NO VICTORY - NO RETURN. Whatever planning in this
      room that took place was determined and very well executed. There are exits to the east and west.
