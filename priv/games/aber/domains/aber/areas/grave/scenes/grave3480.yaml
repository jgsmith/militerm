    short: Narrow Ledge
    sight: >
      As you move toward the ledge you can see that there appears to be no bottom. It would be dangerous to
      try to levitate over the cavern and try to find an exit further north even though there might be one.
      There is not much room to manuever here and there is always the way back south.
