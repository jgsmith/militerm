    short: The Choir Pit
    sight: >
      There is a large area here that was once used by the choir. There are songbooks ripped to shreds, robes
      in scraps, and several corpses lying scattered about. As usual the pews are ripped to shreds and the
      lighting here is very faint. The smell here is not as bad as before but you still have a hard time
      breathing. There are exits to the east, west, and and door to the south.
