    short: Cliff Face
    sight: >
      You are standing at the foot of a high cliff, impossible to climb without specialist equipment. This is
      the pleistocene epoch, and the climate and quality of the air reminds you of home. In the dust at your
      feet you see what looks like the footprint of a man, or at least of an advanced hominid. Just to the
      west is the mouth of a dark cave, and you wonder what it might contain.
