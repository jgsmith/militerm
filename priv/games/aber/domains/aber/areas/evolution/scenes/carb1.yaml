    short: Among The Rotting Stumps
    sight: >
      You are wandering through a fairly open part of the forest, among some decaying &+ytree stumps&*. You
      have to step over fallen lycopod trees in order to progress, and it is slow going. The smell of rotting
      vegetation gets to you after a while, and you feel anxious to move out of the area.
