    short: Shore Of Permian Lake
    sight: >
      You are standing on the shore of a large lake, which stretches away to the east and south. On the far
      shore you can make out several curious-looking large reptiles with on their backs huge skin sails
      supported by tall spines. They belong to the genus Dimetrodon, a pelycosaur often mistakenly called a
      dinosaur. Though they look fearsome, they are too far away to trouble you. You can head north from here
      along the bank of the river which flows into this lake, or you can return west towards the forest, or
      you can try heading south along the edge of the lake.
