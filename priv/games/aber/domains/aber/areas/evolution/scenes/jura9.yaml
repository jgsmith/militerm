    sight: >
      You are wandering through a v-shaped valley, following a river which flows by to the west of you,
      emanating from a gorge to the south. To the north the river veers round to the east, cutting off your
      northward exit. To the east you see a tar pit, in which a large herbivorous dinosaur is struggling in
      vain.
