    sight: >
      You have come to a wall of rock, a faultline perhaps, rising some fifty unclimbable feet above you. As
      you look up you can see a patch of sky through a gap in the gingko foliage, and while you watch, a small
      dark winged shape flaps by. You turn to look at possible exits. It seems the best possible routes lie to
      the south and east.
