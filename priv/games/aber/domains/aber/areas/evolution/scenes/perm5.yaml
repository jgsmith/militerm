    sight: >
      This is where the early synapsid reptiles like to laze in the sunshine. It is an area of large flat
      rocks, baked by the hot sun, and not too far from the shade of the trees. All about you waddle the large
      land animals of the day, both herbivorous and predatory, and most of them are somewhat larger than you.
