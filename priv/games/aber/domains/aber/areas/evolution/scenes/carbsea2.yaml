    sight: >
      You are in shallow water, just off the shore, where cliffs rise out of the sea, making it impossible for
      you to attempt a landing there. You do not feel quite safe here. You can feel yourself rising and
      falling in a heavy swell, and you have to keep swimming in order to prevent yourself drifting ever
      nearer those cliffs.
