    sight: >
      This is the Silurian period. The sea floor bristles with life, with species larger and more
      sophisticated than their Ordovician progenitors. Jawless fish are common here, scooting about in search
      of tasty morsels floating in the murky waters. Although mostly well armoured, they are food for a larger
      menace: the eurypterids, giant water scorpions which crawl along the sea bed waving toothed pincers in
      front of them.
