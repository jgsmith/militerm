      It is quiet here... too quiet. In these still waters small fish feed in peace, and they take no notice
      of you in the slightest. However, you know that appearances can be deceptive, and you constantly turn
      around and around, watching for any signs of large ichthyosaurs which might appear from out of nowhere
      to devour you.
