    sight: >
      You are in the middle of the palaeocene flatlands. Small plants cover the ground, but no grass, which
      will not evolve for millions of years yet. And in place of the dinosaurs, a new terror has sprung up:
      giant predatory flightless birds prowl the plain, feasting on small early hoofed animals and other
      mammals, still small players in the predation stakes.
