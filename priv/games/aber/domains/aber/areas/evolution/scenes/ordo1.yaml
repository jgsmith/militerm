    short: Domain Of The Trilobites
    sight: >
      You are on a large flat plain of Ordovician sand which stretches as far as the eye can see in every
      direction. There is not much of a current here, and you stand upright on the sea bed with ease. To the
      north a wall of rock is broken by a small gloomy-looking grotto, and to the east, between towering
      cliffs, the floor teems with trilobites of all shapes and sizes.
