    sight: >
      You are in a little dip between two of the tallest dunes. Although the northern one looks easily
      scalable, the southern dune is steep and you can get no purchase in the shifting sand. To the west the
      ground drops quickly to the seashore, and clumps of uncovered seaweed tell you that the tide is either
      out or at least not fully in.
