    sight: >
      You are wandering through the woods. An eerie silence sends shivers down your spine, and you keep a
      close eye out for early predatory dinosaurs. A sudden rustle in the undergrowth ahead of you makes you
      jump in alarm, but although you strain hard you cannot see anything in that direction. The ground is
      covered with &+ydead leaves.
