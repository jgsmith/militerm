      The tallest trees you have ever seen reach high into the sky. Strangely, the lowest branches which still
      bear foliage are more than fifty feet high. You surmise that a herd of sauropods must have passed this
      way and eaten their fill. A roar close by makes your hair stand on end, and you hope that whatever made
      it is not still hungry.
