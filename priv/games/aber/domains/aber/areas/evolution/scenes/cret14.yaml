      You are making your way along what must once have been a broad river. It is now, however, all but dry,
      and weeds and shrubs flourish in the moist ground. To the west, not far off, a line of sand dunes blocks
      off your view of the sea. To the east is a tall dike. The dry river bed continues south from here.
