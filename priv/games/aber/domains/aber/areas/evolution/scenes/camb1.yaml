    short: Cambrian Sea Floor
    sight: >
      You are walking on the floor of an ancient and forgotten sea, struggling to maintain your footing in a
      strong current which threatens to sweep you northward. All around you the sea bed teems with life.
      Strange frond-like plants grow here, flattened against the sand by the current. A myriad of small
      creatures, most no longer than six inches, swarms over the sand, feeding on the plants and on each
      other.
