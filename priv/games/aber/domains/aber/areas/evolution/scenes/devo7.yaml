    sight: >
      You are standing on a quiet beach, overhung with the fronds of small clubmoss-like trees crowding
      together by the water's edge. A gentle swell laps against the shore, and you see large fish swimming
      about in the shallows. A few of them, to your surprise, seem to be crawling out of the water a little
      further along the beach to the north.
