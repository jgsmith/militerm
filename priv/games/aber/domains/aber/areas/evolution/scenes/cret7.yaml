    sight: >
      The river rushing by to the north of you plunges down sharply into the ground at this point, reappearing
      a little to the west of you, two hundred feet below. For a moment you contemplate riding the water-slide
      of your life, but only for a moment. You can cross the river to the north, or follow it eastward or
      westward along a stony path.
