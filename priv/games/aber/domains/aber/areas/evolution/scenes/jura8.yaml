    short: Narrow Gorge
    sight: >
      Sheer cliff walls rise up either side of you as you make your way through a narrow gorge, at the bottom
      of which flows a swift-moving but small river. Another river joins this one from the east, and you can
      follow a gully in that direction, or continue north or south along the gorge.
