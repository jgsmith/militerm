    sight: >
      You are wandering through a forest of tall trees of varying girth, the like of which you have never seen
      before. Clubmosses a hundred and fifty feet tall tower into the sky, alongside giant horsetails and,
      much closer to the ground, tree ferns and the primitive seed-bearing ancestors of modern conifers. About
      you swarms a host of insects, many larger than the ones you are used to seeing. Dragonflies with two
      foot wingspans rule the air here, and the noise of their deep-toned humming fills the air. There are
      exits in all directions. Mud and rotting vegetation covers the ground to a depth of over a foot.
