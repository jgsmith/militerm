    sight: >
      The ground here is wet and boggy, and you sink up to your ankles into the mud. Above you, among the
      branches of the trees, small mammals cling to the branches, regarding you with a curious but watchful
      gaze. Still small and unobtrusive, they bide their time, diversifying on a small scale, ready to inherit
      the earth should some tragedy perchance befall the dinosaurs.
