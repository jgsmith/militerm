      A gentle swell tells you that the shore is not far away. You strain your eyes and can just make out that
      in the east the sea bed rises steeply and breaks out of the water just on the limit of your vision.
      Shoals of bony fish are gathered around you, confident that in the shallows here they are less in danger
      of attack from arthrodires.
