    sight: >
      You are battling against a strong current here which sweeps down from the north-east, bringing with it
      shoals of small fish, and the larger predators which feed upon them and, of course, the even larger
      ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs which represent the pinnacle of the food chain. It is these larger monsters
      of which you are ever mindful.
