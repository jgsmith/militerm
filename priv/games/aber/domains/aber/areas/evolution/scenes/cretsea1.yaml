      This is the cretaceous period, and a time of unusual creatures indeed. You wonder what new and alarming
      surprises await you. Shoals of large deep water fish wheel and dart about you, changing direction as one
      in response to some unknown stimulus. You watch in fascination as their silvery bodies catch the light
      from above, almost forgetting the ever-present dangers around you.
