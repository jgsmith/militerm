    sight: >
      You are wandering amid the vastness of the grassy plains of the lower miocene. The ground here is often
      trampled and torn up and you can make out in some places hoof-prints, suggesting that a herd of some
      kind of ruminant, perhaps wildebeest ancestors, have recently passed this way.
