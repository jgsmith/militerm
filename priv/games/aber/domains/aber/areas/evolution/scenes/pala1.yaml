    sight: >
      You are standing atop an outcrop of rock, overlooking a vast plain to the north. Herds of mammals browse
      the flatlands, growing huge to fill the ecological niche left empty by the vanished dinosaurs. Overhead
      soar birds of prey, replacing the pterosaurs of the mesozoic era.
