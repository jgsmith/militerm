      This is the carboniferous period. Arthrodires, surprisingly, are extinct, having suddenly lost interest
      in life at the end of the devonian. The seas are now free for sharks to conquer. To the east is a high
      cliff rising out of the sea, and you would not be able to climb out on to the land there. A better
      beaching point lies to the south.
