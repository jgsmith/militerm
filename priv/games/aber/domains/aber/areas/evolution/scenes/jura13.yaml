    sight: >
      You are at the edge of a broad lake whose far shore you can only barely make out in the haze. By the
      lakeside are cycads and palm trees, but to the south is a forest of much larger trees. At the foot of
      one of the tall palms is a &+Cflat stone&*, on which you could sit and rest if you wish.
