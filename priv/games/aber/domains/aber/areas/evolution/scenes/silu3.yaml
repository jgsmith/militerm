    short: Sea Floor Dunes
    sight: >
      Great sand dunes rise about you on the sea bed, endlessly shifting in the currents. Tiny creatures
      burrow frantically into the sand as you approach. You are no doubt the biggest creature they have ever
      seen. Large rambling sea plants dot the dunes in places, somehow having adapted to the inconstant nature
      of their habitat.
