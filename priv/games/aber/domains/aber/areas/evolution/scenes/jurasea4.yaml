    sight: >
      Giant swarms of krill, small shrimp-like creatures, are providing food here for the smaller predators of
      the day, who find them an easy meal in comparison to the lithe fish they are more accustomed to feeding
      upon. You cannot help but feel that they would provide poor fare, however.
