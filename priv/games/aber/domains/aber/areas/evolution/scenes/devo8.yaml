    sight: >
      You are standing on a gently sloping beach, on the edge of a forest of lycopods. As you walk along the
      shoreline, a number of large fish with powerful-looking fins scuttle into the water. Further up the
      beach you spy other creatures, fish-like and yet not so... You wonder if these creatures bridge the
      evolutionary gap between fish and amphibians.
