    short: Baobab Trees
    sight: >
      You are standing in the shade of a broad baobab tree in the latter half of the pliocene epoch. There are
      several more nearby, but they are too spread out to be called a grove. Monkeys chatter at you from the
      branches, and they throw fruit at you when you stray too near.
