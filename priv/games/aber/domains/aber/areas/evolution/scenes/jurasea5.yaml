    short: Decline Of The Ichthyosaurs
    sight: >
      You are swimming through the oceans in the latter part of the jurassic period. To the north are deeper
      waters, though since you cannot see the bottom you have no idea just how deep they are. You shiver
      involuntarily, ill-at-ease in this aquatic environment. You notice that the once-common ichthyosaurs
      seem to be more rare here, and you wonder why their numbers should be declining.
