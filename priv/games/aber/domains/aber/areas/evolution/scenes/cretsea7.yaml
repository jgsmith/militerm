    sight: >
      The sea here is so shallow that when you stand on the sea bed, your head is above the level of the
      water. Looking east you can see the cretaceous scenery stretching for miles. Wooded hills and lush
      valleys dominate the landscape. To the immediate east is a sandy beach, where scuttling crabs forage for
      scraps of food.
