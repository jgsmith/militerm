    sight: >
      You are picking your way through a difficult patch of ground. Pinnacles of rock thrust out of the ground
      and deep fissures divide it, making you very wary of where you put your feet. To the west the ground
      becomes just too treacherous to negotiate, so you resolve to head south or west towards easier footings.
