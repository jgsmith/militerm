    sight: >
      You are swimming through the ocean surrounding the giant supercontinent Pangaea. Marine life is scarce,
      having been all but wiped out by the mass extinctions of the late permian, yet among the survivors a
      number of new and terrifying creatures have emerged. The ichthyosaurs, or "fish lizards", are
      dolphin-like predators ranging from sizes smaller than yourself up to monsters the size of whales. You
      resolve to proceed with caution.
