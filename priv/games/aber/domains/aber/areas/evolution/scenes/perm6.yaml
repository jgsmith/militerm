      You are at the end of a long spit extending into the lake. As you look into the water your gaze is met
      by large amphibians, still major players in the evolutionary power struggle. You know, however, that
      they are doomed: the rapid advancement of the reptiles is destined to leave the amphibians far behind
      before long, and eventually these hulking monsters will give rise to humble little hopping creatures,
      croaking by the sides of ponds and rivers. The &+ygravel&* is disturbed, as if someone has been digging
      here.
