    short: On The Plateau
    sight: >
      You are wandering about on the top of the plateau. As you sweat in the intense heat, you attract clouds
      of flies and have to constantly brush them from your face. Some of them, you can't help noticing, are
      biting flies. If one should happen to get preserved in amber, perhaps your DNA will some day be
      recovered and provide future scientists with a major headache.
