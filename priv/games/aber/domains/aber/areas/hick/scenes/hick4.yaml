    sight: >
      You are at the end of the main road that leads up to the Hickdale House. It is a nice looking house that
      seems to have been worn away by the elements over the years. It is a dull white house made of wood that
      looks to be a little rotted out. The porch of the house is to the north, and the roads leads back to the
      south. To the east is the road to the livestock area.
