    sight: >
      There is a sandy patch of ground here. A few bits of scrub brush are here, but otherwise there is no
      vegetation. Come to think of it, there are no animals here, either. The air smells tainted, as if a
      great spell had been cast, or as if some evil being has been here recently.
