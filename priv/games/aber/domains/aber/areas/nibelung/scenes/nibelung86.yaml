    sight: >
      You are in an enormous cave. The ceiling is well out of the range of your lightsource, as are several of
      the walls. You can hear the echo of dripping water in the distance. A great feeling of awe overcomes you
      as you contemplate the great power that must have gone into the makings of such a large cavern. The
      dampness chills you a bit as you weave across the room, trying to avoid some puddles of greenish water
      that lie about. A small opening in the south wall catches your attention.
