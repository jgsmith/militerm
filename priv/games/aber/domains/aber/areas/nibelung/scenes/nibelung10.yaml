    sight: >
      The mountains rise up sharply before you. The air is much colder here, and a cold breeze blows down from
      the pass above you. Below you are the lowlands of this mountainous area, and grasses and scrub brush can
      be seen struggling to grow there. The path is littered with chunks of granite from the eons of creation
      that have passed.
