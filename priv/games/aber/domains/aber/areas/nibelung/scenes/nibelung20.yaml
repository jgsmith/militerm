    sight: >
      You are standing by a burbling river, the clean water passing over the riverbed, and continuing off to
      the north. The sunshine and warm breeze lend to a feeling of peacefulness in the area. Some cute fish
      are swimming about happily. To your west, a wooden bridge spans the river, and to the east a path slopes
      upwards.
