    sight: >
      On the path before you, the arched gateway to a town is attempting to stand. Off to the left and right,
      the remains of an outer wall taper off into the brush. Weeds can be seen growing here and there from the
      cracks. A rusted gate hangs off one hinge, but you realize it won't be much longer.
