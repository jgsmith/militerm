    short: Mouth of Canyon
    sight: >
      You are standing at the mouth of a very large canyon. The light here is dimmer, as the sun dips behind
      the western rim of the valley. To the south is the rocky soil of the base of the mountains. The peaks of
      the Teeth rise up to the east, their majestic beauty stealing your breath for a moment.
