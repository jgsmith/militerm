    short: Inner Hall
    sight: >
      This room appears to be one of the inner halls of the castle. A doorway opens up to a guard's room to
      the north, while another doorway stands to the west. The hall is rather cramped compared to some of the
      other rooms of the castle proper. A few small tapestries attempt to enliven the otherwise dismal walls
      of the hall.
