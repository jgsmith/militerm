    sight: >
      You find yourself in a small anteroom of the castle. The room is now bare, but looks like it was once
      comfortably furnished. Some cobwebs have been spun by spiders past, and now collect dust in the corners.
      To the north you see the main entrance to the castle, to the west is the library. A small &+yhole&* has
      been made on the south wall.
