    sight: >
      The road splits off into several directions here. It appears to have rained here recently, and the road
      to the south looks muddy. A sandy patch lies off to the west, and you see a dilapidated structure off to
      the north. You hear a babbling river off to the east, its pleasant tones putting you into a relaxed
      mood.
