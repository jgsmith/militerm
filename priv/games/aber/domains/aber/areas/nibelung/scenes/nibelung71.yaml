    sight: >
      This is apparently the tower of the wizard Parsifal. As you think back, you recall hearing of the
      greatness of Parsifal in a Bard's tale long ago. Once the Hohenzollern family was well-respected, but
      seemed to have run into problems with a dragon that Parsifal had tried to tame. Nothing had been heard
      from the family since, and no one ever successfully returned from their castle. A small bed is in one
      corner of the room, and a table in the other. The table is covered with old books and sheets of
      parchment. A chair has been overturned in the center of the room.
