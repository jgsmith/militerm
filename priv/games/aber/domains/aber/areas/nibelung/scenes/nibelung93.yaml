    sight: >
      The basement is full of papers, now rotting, food, now rotting, and castle furniture, now rotting. The
      rock walls are slightly damp to the touch and the packed dirt of the floor is rather muddy now. Some
      rusting braces in the walls were once used for torches, which are now gone. A tunnel slopes sharply
      downwards into a room below, while stairs will take you back to the kitchen above.
