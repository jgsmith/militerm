    sight: >
      You are standing in a very long hall. The wooden floorboards echo to the tread of your booted feet as
      you walk down the hall. The many windows in this hall allow a great amount of light into the room.
      Stuffed animal heads, like lions and tigers and bears (Oh my!), are hung periodically along the wall.
      The ceiling is painted with murals depicting the hunts where the various trophies were acquired. To the
      east is the main entrance of the castle, and to the south is a trophy room. A large table in the room to
      the west brings you to the conclusion that it's a dining room.
