      The cemetery is a small, private lot. A few marble headstones mark the resting place of some of the
      town's former residents. Tufts of grass are growing here and there, but otherwise the ground is barren.
      A small breeze blows past, stirring the dust up a bit. One tombstone reads, "Here lies George Pratt. He
      missed the cliff, now he's flat."
