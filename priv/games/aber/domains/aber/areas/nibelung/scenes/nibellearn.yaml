      The room is lined with row upon row of books, maps, and charts. You smell incense, and your nose leads
      you through the maze of shelves towards the middle of the room. In the middle is a recession lined with
      pillows in which a slender woman sits cross-legged. Her white and red robes flow about the floor, and
      seem much too heavy for such a slight body. Upon your entrance though, she stands fully up and glides
      over to you without a hint of effort, white and red following behind her.
