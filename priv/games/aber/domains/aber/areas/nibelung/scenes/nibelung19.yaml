    sight: >
      There is a dirt path which slopes down to the west, and rises to the east. (Of course.) You can hear the
      sound of running water off to the west, and a bridge off in the distance makes you realize there must be
      a river there. There are fields of wildflowers stretching off to the north and south, their vibrant
      colors waving about in the cool autumn breeze.
