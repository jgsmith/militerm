    sight: >
      You are standing in a little red schoolhouse. From your cursory glance, it doesn't appear as if anyone
      has been learning here recently. The chalkboard is smashed, and papers and books lie scattered about the
      room. The desks and chairs have been thrown about, lending to the look of chaos. A doorway leads out to
      the south.
