      Many beakers, flasks and retorts make the purpose of this room clear. Along one wall a bookshelf leans,
      covered with old, leather-bound books of varying size and color. A table in the center of the room is
      covered in beakers full of different liquids, some purple, some green, and many other colors. A wooden
      stool sits next to the table, apparently for the person who worked in the lab. A draft blows in from the
      tower base to the north.
