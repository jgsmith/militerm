    short: Decaying Land
    sight: >
      The land here is, well, decaying. The trees are mere skeletons, and the grass is brown and dry. Nothing
      seems to be living here, and you notice the absence of birds chirping, and the usual hum of mosquitos.
      The air smells musty and old, like the inside of a vacuum.
