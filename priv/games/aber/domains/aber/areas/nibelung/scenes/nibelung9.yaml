      It's not the Grand Canyon, but it'll do. The light here is very dim, as the sun is well beyond the rim
      of the canyon. It is much cooler here too, but the air is fresh and clean. There are some wildflowers
      and brush growing here and there. The northern end appears to be blocked, but there is a path to the
      south. There are some birds chirping in the distance.
