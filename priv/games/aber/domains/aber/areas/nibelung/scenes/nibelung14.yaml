    sight: >
      You are in the northern foothills of Zaryat's Teeth. The tall mountain craggs rise up to the south,
      their snow covered peaks reflecting the orange glow of the setting sun. Above you there is a clearing,
      which would appear to offer a beautiful vantage point to look out over the lands below. A trail winds
      its way down to the northern areas.
