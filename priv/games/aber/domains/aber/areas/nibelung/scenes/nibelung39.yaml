      The cellar is very damp and musty. Off in the blackness you hear the sound of dripping water. A mouse
      runs away into a crevasse at the sound of your approach. The floor - had it been dry - would be dirt,
      but is currently occupied with the task of being mud instead. It pulls at your boots slightly as you
      step off the final step. In front of you is a pedestal with a box resting on it. From its long,
      rectangular shape, and ornate finish, you guess it to be a coffin.
