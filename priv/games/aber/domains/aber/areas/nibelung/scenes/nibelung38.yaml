    short: Abandoned House
    sight: >
      Inside the abandoned house you find lots of cobwebs, some dust and little else. To the north, through
      some rotting doorposts, you see an old cellarhole. A bench is along one wall, one leg partially chewed
      out by parasites of some kind. A rotting door is off to your left, one hinge still holding it in place,
      the other has apparently decided to go on to better things. To the west, through another doorway, you
      see a gazebo.
