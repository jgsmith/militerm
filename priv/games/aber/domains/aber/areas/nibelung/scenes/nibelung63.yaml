    short: Tapestry Room
    sight: >
      This small room used to house the castle's many fine tapestries. A few mouldy ones remain, hanging
      limply and unattractively from the walls. Some straw covers the floor, apparently an attempt to make the
      room more comfort- able. There are several iron hooks in the wall that used to hold torches, but have
      been emptied long ago.
