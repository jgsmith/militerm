      Silk draperies and soft music mark this room. The muted conversations of other patrons can be heard,
      discussing the days arduous adventures. A tuxedo-clad host leads you to your table. As you sit down, you
      notice a few of the other patrons glancing at you respectfully. It appears your name has spread further
      than even you had suspected.
