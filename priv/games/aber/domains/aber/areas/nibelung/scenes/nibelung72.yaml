    short: Damp Tunnel
    sight: >
      Water drips from the ceiling and runs along miniscule cracks in the walls. A thin layer of mud on the
      floor coats about an inch of your boots, and makes walking difficult as you slide about. The tunnel
      slopes down sharply, and it takes great effort to keep from sliding to the bottom. You can make out the
      base of the tower above you.
