    short: Damp Tunnel
    sight: >
      The air is clammy and cool against your exposed skin. The dampness pervades the air and room about you,
      chilling you a bit. Apparently this used to be under the moat and leaked quite profusely. The tunnel
      continues off to the east, and slopes upwards sharply.
