    sight: >
      You are standing in an archway which runs through the center of a very large tower. Some steps lead
      upwards to the upper levels of the tower and a drawbridge is open to the west. Your boots click upon the
      cobblestones, and you notice a rusty porticullis dangling overhead. A path wanders off to the east.
