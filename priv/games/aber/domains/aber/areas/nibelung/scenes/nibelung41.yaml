    sight: >
      You are in a small alley. The street continues off to the west, towards the center of town, and ends in
      a wall to the east. Off to the south you see a parsonage to a church. There are some containers of
      garbage here, but the contents have been partially consumed by something. Your nose curls from the
      stench here.
