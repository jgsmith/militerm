    short: Drawbridge
    sight: >
      The drawbridge appears to have been open for many years. The chains hold- ing both sides are rusty and
      stiff. To your west you notice the inner gate to a castle, now in ruins, while a large tower, probably
      for fortification, rises to the east. The moat below appears to have dried out long ago.
