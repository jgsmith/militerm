    sight: >
      You are standing in the square of the town. The road is in really bad condition here and you realize
      that this town has been emptied of people for quite some time. To the north is the village gate, and
      lands beyond. Off to the west you see a play area of some sort. To the south you notice a bandstand or
      something.
