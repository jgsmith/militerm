    sight: >
      You are amongst the peaks of the mountains. It is very cold here, and a strong wind stirs up the snow
      around you, making it difficult to see. The snow is much deeper here, and small amounts of it slip into
      your boots from time to time, making them cold. It seems very quiet and desolate up here, and no one has
      apparently been along in quite some time. But with the shifting, drifting snow, it is difficult to tell.
