    short: An undulating room.
    sight: >
      This room undulates with an aura of incredible evil. The shifting floor causes you to stagger
      uncontrollably, while the ceiling rhythmically pumps upwards and downwards. You can feel the lifeblood
      draining from your body. To stay here long would surely mean the end of you. You feel a strong draft
      coming from the north.
