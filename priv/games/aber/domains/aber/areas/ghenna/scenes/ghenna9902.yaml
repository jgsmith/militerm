    sight: >
      A large &+Cfountain&* containing the tears of those slain within the city limits has been erected here,
      abutting the east wall of the city - it looks quite deep and wide. The water is a crystaline blue which
      exudes holiness, something quite strange for such an evil city. Exits lead West, North and South.
