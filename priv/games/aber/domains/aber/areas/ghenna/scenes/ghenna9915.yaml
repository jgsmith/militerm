    sight: >
      You are standing inside Blood Tavern - a bizarre looking place, at first sight. The parquet floor creaks
      under the weight of an odd looking bar to the north which seems to be moving somehow. Next to the bar a
      stairwell disappears into blackness above. The ceiling is vaulted, and sports three candeled
      chandeliers, which hang like victims above you.
