    sight: >
      This is an arched cavern of great size - it looks like the Houston Astrodome. a great ledge of rock juts
      out above your head, showering you with a steady gush of blood and entrails. A raucous sound of
      crunching viscera, intermingled with a slurp here and there, turns your stomach. Then you hear it... an
      encouraging voice which keeps repeating "Yes, yes, thats it... just a few steps more...You're almost
      there."
