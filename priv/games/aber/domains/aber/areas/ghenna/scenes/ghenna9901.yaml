    sight: >
      You are standing inside the city limits of Ghenna. Once a booming barter town, it is now a haven for the
      evil which it bred over long years under the rule of the hubristic Lord Suzerain. In virtually every
      corner you see ruins of some sort or another intermingled with old, age-whitened bones from all manner
      of beasts. Exits lead in all cardinal directions.
