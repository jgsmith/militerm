    sight: >
      You are standing inside the cave entrance, where a strong smell of sulfur makes you gag. Large stone
      steps lead back downward to where a labyrinth of bodies can be seen. A steady stream of blood seems to
      be trickling from somewhere up north, where a sound similar to a giant bellows can be heard.
