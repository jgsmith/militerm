    sight: >
      A long bar stands here constructed of God only knows what. It appears to be made of human flesh sewn
      together with the hair of various beasts. Although sturdy, the bar is very pliant to the touch, and it
      seems to be MOVING ever so slightly, as if it were ALIVE! A stairwell is here, leading upwards into
      blackness.
