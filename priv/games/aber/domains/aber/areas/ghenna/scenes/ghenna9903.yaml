    short: The smell of death.
    sight: >
      You are standing in what appears to be the town graveyard. Nobody feels the need to bury the dead, so
      the corpses are just strewn about in no particular order. And the smell, oh boy! It's all you can do to
      keep from losing your lunch right now. The corpses are stacked too high to exit East, but you can pass
      North, South or West.
