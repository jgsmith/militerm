    sight: >
      A card table constructed from the skeleton of an odd quadroped sits here, with a few unplayed &+Chands&*
      left sitting upon it... Wonder where the rest of the poor souls' bodies are. The tavern door lies east
      of here, while to the north is a bar made of what appears to be human skin.
