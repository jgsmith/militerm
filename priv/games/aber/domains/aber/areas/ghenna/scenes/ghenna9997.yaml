    sight: >
      You have entered a 20 foot square opening that appears to be a lair of some sort. Bones lie strewn about
      in every corner - most of them appear to be human bones. A big pile of treasure sits in the center of
      the room covered with the red mucus that lines the walls here. Exits lead in all cardinal directions.
