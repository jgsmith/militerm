    sight: >
      This ledge is slippery with the blood of hundreds of vanquished adventurers who made the mistake of
      entering here. Corpses, corpses, everywhere. At least you finally found the source of that horrific
      sulfur smell. A black, steaming substance is smeared all over the walls emitting the funk. As if this
      werent bad enough, you suddenly have the feeling that your life is about to end soon. ---> HASTA LA
      VISTA!
