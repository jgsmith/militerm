    sight: >
      This backwall niche is dank, dark and dusty. The brick walls show the telltale signs of decay - red and
      black flakes, which lay on the floor. An old &+Mcask&* of port wine lies broken in one corner, a relic
      from happier times. The only apparent exit is back to the West.
