    sight: >
      There is so much junk in the street here, that you have to walk in a zigzag around it. The outline of a
      doorframe is all that remains of the building to the South. The building to the North, however, looks a
      bit more intact. The street ends towards the East, near a mountain of rubble. To the West, the street
      goes on for some distance.
