    sight: >
      Wow! Looks like you just stepped into hell... or at least, a little corner of it. Flames dance on the
      walls, causing the light to play tricks on your eyes. You can just barely make out a dark figure to the
      north. Looks to be some sort of stairwell back up to the west, and a bedroom to the east.
