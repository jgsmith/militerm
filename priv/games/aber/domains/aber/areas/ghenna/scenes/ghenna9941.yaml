    sight: >
      You have entered the magical abode of the great Efreeti. Done in an eastern motif, this room glimmers
      with all the amenities one could want. Pillows, rugs and candelabra are everywhere. This definitely
      looks like the lap of luxury. To the North lies the forbidden treasure room, to enter it is to ask for
      certain death.
