    sight: >
      The grasslands spread out far and wide, all around you. A steady wind blows across this open area,
      causing the grasses to appear as brownish waves at times, forever being carried along to unknown
      destinations. The grasses certainly are a beautiful sight, however they also provide for a deadly
      opportunity for all manner of hunting predators - care in where you step is well advised.
