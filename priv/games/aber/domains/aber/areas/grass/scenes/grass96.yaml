    sight: >
      You stand in a huge field of tall, wind-blown grass. The grass grows wild all around you, the tops of
      the stalks easily at waist level, many times even higher than that. Northward is the border of a light
      forest, south it looks almost as if the land drops away, maybe there is a cliff or steep valley of some
      sort.
