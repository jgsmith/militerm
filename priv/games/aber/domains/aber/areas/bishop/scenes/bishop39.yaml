    short: Circle of Gravestones
    sight: >
      A raised ring of graves is set in a clearing here, perfectly spaced from each other and having the same
      length. In the center of this circle stands a small plinth made of oozing blood. The flow of this liquid
      of life is kept going by a dark blue fireball on the top of the plinth, which shoots out random arcs of
      green lightning. Surrounding the tombstone perimeter of the circles are offering bowls jammed with
      platinum coins and pearl amulets, their lustrous qualities having long since degraded.
