      Long, tall, thin grasses grow everywhere in this prairie, blowing in the cross winds and shedding their
      pollen to the skies. Crickets chirp from deep within the grass, forever only to be heard. Among the
      grasses are also various types of grain. The wild herds of oxen and cows which roam these plains live in
      utter bliss with the sheer amount of food present around them. Spread throughout the prairie are patches
      set aside by nature for extremely tall sunflowers. These circles of petals around a darker core grow in
      unconcealed delight as they process the natural radiation tossed down at them. The fine dirt road leads
      south deeper into the prairie and north to a cottage.
