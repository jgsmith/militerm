      The dry goods of the house seem to manage themselves well in this dark shelter. Wooden shelves with
      metal rivets line the boarded walls and struts in here, supporting the many raw ingredients, salts, and
      spices used by the caretaker. A large oaken door with elaborate cross-braces lies open, and light
      filters in from the upstairs trapdoor.
