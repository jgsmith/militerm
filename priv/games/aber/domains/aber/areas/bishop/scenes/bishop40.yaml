    sight: >
      The body of a high druid priest was incarcerated here nearly 500 years ago. His mummified remains occupy
      an engraved sarcophagus set atop a marble pedestal in the pit of the crypt. The air is fresh as the
      crypt was broken open and plundered many years back, but equally fresh rodent and snake droppings
      confirm that there are still visitors here.
