      A set of stairs lead up to a rickety wooden porch. A wall cover of ivy drapes the supports of the house,
      and potted plants line the far side, their leaves sprawled to receive the sunlight. Stained-glass
      windows fill in their squarish panes, and a circle of branded designs encompass the doorway.
