      Clouds hang motionless in the bright blue sky which surrounds the travelers disc. Also present among the
      softly-hued atmosphere are dark green organic bodies from which long tentacles droop. When a native bird
      or stray air current containing particles of plant matter brushes against these tendrils, the agile
      limbs waste no time in capturing and paralyzing. The bodies float on the air currents and vary enough in
      altitude to allow safe passage down to a flat land scape.
