    short: Circle of Cropped Grass
    sight: >
      A nearly perfect circle of cropped grass stands here in a remote area of this prairie. Eleven steel
      chairs stand in a ring around the outer edge, and on these chairs are bolted ankle, wrist, and neck
      shackles. In front of each chair is a solid iron cup stained raspberry red from the blood of human
      sacrifices performed here. There are no people currently here, but small rivers of blood flow from the
      cups to a block of hardened steel in the center of this circle. Eleven piles of bones brittle with age
      and parched from the elements lay heaped individually, where the are placed in such a way as to ward off
      visitors. The blood trails follow up from the sides of this sacrilegious altar and are drunk by the open
      mouths of the sightless skulls.
