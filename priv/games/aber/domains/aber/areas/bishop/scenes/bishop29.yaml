    sight: >
      Bugs have feasted on some of the gigantic ferns present in here. Winged insects hop from flower to
      flower, attracted by the petal color and scent of nectar. The monks have grown this garden from
      seedlings and lay down fresh dirt and mulch every spring. Pruning takes place in the fall to allow the
      cycle of growth and rebirth to remain unbroken. Water is fed from tens of small, elegantly carved
      fountains in the shape of bison and dolphins. Paths lead in all directions from here, giving access to
      private nooks within the leafy garden. Where one of the perimeter walls stands, clumps of well-tended
      icy provide a sense of background and completion to the garden as well as a quick means of scaling the
      wall if the monastery is attacked.
