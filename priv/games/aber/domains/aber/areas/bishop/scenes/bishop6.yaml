    sight: >
      Fierce winds pull at your clothes and hair as the vortex slowly whirls you around in circles. Lines of
      bright light emanate from various points, streaking past like sun rays or lasers, but none contain
      enough power to be threatening. One exit of this portal is to the west, leading to a dark tunnel, and
      the lines of light squiggle in arrow formations vectoring generally east and west.
