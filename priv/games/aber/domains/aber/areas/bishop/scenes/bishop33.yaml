      The fertile and rolling plains are broken by sporadic patches of thorny briars and seven foot tall
      thistles. The road becomes pitted with rocks and holes, turning the terrain into a weed-consumed
      landscape. Dead tangles of ivy and poison oak grow in increasing quantities, their long, brown-leafed
      vines winding around a pair of rusty iron gates to the east.
