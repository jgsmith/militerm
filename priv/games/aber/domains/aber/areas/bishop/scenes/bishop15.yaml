      The spirit of 'home sweet home' and nostalgia are ever-present in here. On a brick fireplace mantle lay
      the small heirlooms of the dirt road's caretaker - a whittled duck, a brass pair of night goggles, an
      engraved necklace, and a leather coat-of-arms. Two rocking chairs, a small desk, and a well-sanded desk,
      all made of wood, represent the main complement of furniture.
