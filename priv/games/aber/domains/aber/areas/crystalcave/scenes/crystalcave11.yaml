    sight: >
      &+BWater&N spills down the west wall reflecting the &+Wlight&N making it seem like liquid &+Wcrystal&N.
      Mosses cling to the walls, giving off a decidedly &+ggreen&N tint. Steam rises from the &+Bpool&N of
      &+Bwater&N just inches from your feet. You wish you could stand under the falls and wash all your
      troubles away. Looking over your shoulder, you heave a weary sigh, not wishing to find your way back
      through the seemingly endless &+Wcrystal&N passages.
