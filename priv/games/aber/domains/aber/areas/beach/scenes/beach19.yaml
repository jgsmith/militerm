    sight: >
      This is a calm beautiful sea, the sun casts its rays upon these smooth, calm, open, waters and reflects
      back into your eyes, as a stunning orange image. To the south, there is a harbour, from here it looks
      quiet, and peaceful, you are sure it would be a wonderful place to visit.
