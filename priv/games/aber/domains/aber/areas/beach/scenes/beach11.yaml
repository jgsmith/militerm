    short: Beautiful sea
    sight: >
      This is a calm beautiful sea, the sun casts its rays upon these smooth, calm, open, waters and reflects
      back into your eyes, as a stunning orange image. There is nothing here that would cause you fear, the
      waters are calm, and smooth, and the sailing is wonderful.
