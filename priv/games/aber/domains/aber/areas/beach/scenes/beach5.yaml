    sight: >
      This is a secluded edge of the beach, receded slightly from the incoming tide. From here you can see the
      entire beach, and what a marvelous sight it is. Off to the north just a bit further, is a small dock,
      and past that to the north is what appears to be a picnic area. Hungry?
