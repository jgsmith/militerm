    sight: >
      You stand at the edge of the sea shore staring at a huge rock formation which could be described (sort
      of) as a plateau rising up out if the ocean floor and holding a sizable village atop it. To the north is
      the cliff face you have been following, which happens to put an end to this path just a little ways
      northeast from your current position. West the path heads along the beach for quite a long distance.
