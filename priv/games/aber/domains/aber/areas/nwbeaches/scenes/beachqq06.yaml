    sight: >
      You stand on a beach which stretches east to west for as far as your eyes can see. Jumbles of rock and
      scree litter the way here, making it so you must watch your step. You notice a bit of wood, partially
      buried in the sand of the beach here. West is more rocky beach, while east the way gets a bit more flat.
