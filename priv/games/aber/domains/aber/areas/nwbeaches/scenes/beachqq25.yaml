      You have begun a descent down into the Lower Reaches of the Lighthouse. You wonder why the basement of
      this happy home would not only be called the 'Lower Reaches', but also capitalized for a moment - and
      then you see what lies below you. Looking almost like a medieval torture chamber, you see a room all in
      stone, a deep cavernous hole in the center of it. What looks to be an operating table is set to one side
      with tables covered in instruments of dissection and bubbling vials close by. Do you really wish to
      descend into that room and visit with the 'good' Lighthouse Keeper?
