      This small ten by ten room once was a simple like the others which connect to the Operating Room,
      however because of the nature of the specimen which abides in this space, it has been spruced up just a
      bit. A huge bed dominates the ENTIRE room, pillows strewn everywhere with lace and frills and all.
