      The path continues for a long way both east and west. To the west lies the land bridge which the peoples
      of this continent used in ancient times to escape the great evil which had invaded their homeland. The
      great evil even their goddess could not defend them from. It was the goddess who created the land
      bridge, and sealed the Evil deep within their holes, under the village.
