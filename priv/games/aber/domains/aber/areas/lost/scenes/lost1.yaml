      A sense of peace marks this place. A carven wooden structure which might have at one time been an altar
      remains, untouched by time. A pure white flame, flickering at your presense floats above the side of the
      altar. Beneath the flame is a hole filled with shimmering energy. Sunlight filters down through tree
      limbs, reflected by the enegry and shattered into a myriad of tiny rainbows.
