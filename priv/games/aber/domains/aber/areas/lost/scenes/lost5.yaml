      Ocean waters lap at either side of this narrow trail, yet somehow never over-run it. The earth is still
      mucky though, for the ocean only recently reliquished it as dry land. The people of the forgotten
      continent had fled across this narrow strip of earth centuries of years before, and their goddess had
      closed it behind them. The time has come to vanquish the evil which waits, trapped within the great
      tree.
