      You have entered the bedroom of Bargalad and Pandora. Just looking around this room it is easy to tell
      that they are newlyweds. The large, comfortable waterbed is covered with a plaid comforter in bright
      yellows, blues, and reds. The bed covers are folded down to reveal white satin sheets. A lovely yellow
      rose has been placed across the pillows. Above the bed there is a beautiful oil painting of a couple on
      their wedding day. (Bargalad and Pandora maybe?) You can't help but stare at the handsome couple. A very
      large television is pushed against the wall facing the bed, and a copy of 'The Medicine Man' is still
      playing. A large victorian mirror dominates a wooden chest of drawers, and pictures of the couple and
      their family and friends cover the top. Next to you is an open door which seems to lead into another
      room. A huge window allows in enough light to illuminate the room. The window, which is framed in bright
      yellow curtains that are pinned up with matching bows, overlooks a breathtaking view of the lands below.
      As you walk around the room and your feet sink into the plush wall to wall carpeting, you can't help but
      think how lucky Bargalad and Pandora must be.
