    sight: >
      You are standing on the southeast side of the square. The rioters seem to have left alone the building
      to the south, probably of the fact of the sign out front that says: "Looters will be decapitated." It
      appears that armor is for sale there. To the east, a building houses the Headquarters of the Sash
      Mercenary Company. The square continues north and west.
