      You stand before the Clerics' Guild where men of the cloth gather to learn and rest from their
      missionary work. It also serves as a safe haven for those in trouble. The rioters left this place alone
      because the clerics put the fear of God in them--somehow it didn't seem enough to reform their behavior.
      The back of the supply shop lies to the south. The street continues west and east.
