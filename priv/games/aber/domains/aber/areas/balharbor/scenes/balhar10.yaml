    sight: >
      You are standing southwest of the statue. This corner of the square is dominated by the House of Pets to
      the west and the Weapons Shop to the south. The building to the west looks like it was vandalized but
      the shop to the south looks like it was untouched by the riots, probably because the sign on the front
      that says: "Looters will be decapitated."
