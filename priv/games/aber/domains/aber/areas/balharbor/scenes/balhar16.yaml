    sight: >
      You step inside the Sash Headquarters into the reception area. This place is carefully guarded from the
      rioters in order to protect the sash commander. It looks to be highly furnished, with a beautiful rug
      with the sash insignia sewn into it spread on the floor. Some trophies of past sash excursions line the
      walls along with a few skulls of those gotten rid of. If you can get past the guards you can go south
      into the commander's office.
