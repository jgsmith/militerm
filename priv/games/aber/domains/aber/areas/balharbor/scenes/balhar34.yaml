    short: The Scribe Shop
    sight: >
      This little shop suffered little damage from the riot since this place houses the town's only scribe,
      who warded off the thugs by reciting fireball spells at them from the front of the shop using the
      scrolls he made. Looking at the shelves, you can see some scrolls for sale. There's a sign on the wall
      that says 'No Spell-Casting Allowed'.
