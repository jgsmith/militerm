      Oh, man look at this place! Smashed windows, glassware, wooden doors, even the walls totally busted up
      into itty-bitty pieces! Why would someone want to do this? The wrath they hold deeply within themselves
      drove them into insane human wrecking machines destroying everything in their path-- nothing was spared
      from that destruction as you can see here. The home, built with the owner's life savings gained through
      hard work and investment is now a wreck and uninhabitable. Whoever the scum that did this must pay and
      pay dearly for his crime! This heart-breaking scene can be left to the east through the front door, uh,
      looks like that was ripped off the hinges.
