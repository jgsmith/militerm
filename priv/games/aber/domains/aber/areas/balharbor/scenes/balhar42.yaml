      This is the gathering place where potential new apprentices-wizards are trained and educated on the fine
      art of spellcasting. The guildmaster kept this place from being burned to the ground when he bravely
      went out burned his attackers instead. A door to the south leads to the tower, apparently because a
      former guildmaster was friends of the owner.
