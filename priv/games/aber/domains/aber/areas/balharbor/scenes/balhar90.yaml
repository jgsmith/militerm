    sight: >
      Another dock extends out several feet into the seafront for a ship or several small boats to pull into
      the harbor and unload their cargo. Here you can ship out to sea if you have any watercraft. North is the
      Mermaid's Song, and to the west side of the dock you can see a beachfront.
