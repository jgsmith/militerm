      Boy it's sure dark in here, hope you brought some light. The foyer area is lit up with some torches
      hanging about but you can't see much of anything down any of the corridors. Eerie noises can be heard
      from some unknown source. You wonder who, or what is living inside this tower. Wonder where the host is
      to give you a guided tour?
