    sight: >
      Some children can be seen playing on the swings, the rockers, the merry-go-round, the monkeybars, and
      the slides. Most of the equipment here is fairly new and seems to have been built so even the "bigger"
      kids like you can use it. There's a clearing to the north, more playground east, and picnic areas to the
      south.
