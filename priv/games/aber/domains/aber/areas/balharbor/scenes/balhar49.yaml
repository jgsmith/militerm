    short: Foot of the Climbing Wall
    sight: >
      A one-hundred-foot high wall stands here where warriors and thieves come to practice their climbing
      skills. Unfortunately, some nasty activity-- a riot--rages here making any attempts to climb the wall
      impossible. Some of those rioters are up there on that wall to lob rocks at the police. Unruly angry
      people chant rebellion slogans and call for the governor's head (without a body).
