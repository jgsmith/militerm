    short: Road Leading From the Forest
    sight: >
      This road rapidly changes from rocks to hard dirt to the east. Seems that those heavy carriages have dug
      their wheels in it so often you can tell where the trail is without being deverted. Must have been a
      bumpy ride, you can see the tree roots sticking out of the dirt along the way. The trip on foot won't be
      easy, cause the growth disguises the trail a bit heading in deeper. Hope you brought your compass.
      Avoiding getting lost can be achieved by returning to the west, although you think you see more people
      than trees...what's that all about?
