      You've about a hundred feet up, and if you're not in good shape, you may want to rest a little before
      continuing up. Those heading down, you're close to the bottom. A beautiful waterfall crashes down to a
      pool to the south. Its waters are flowing past you to the north and spilling further down the side of
      the plateau.
