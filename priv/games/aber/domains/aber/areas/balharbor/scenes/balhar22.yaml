    short: Idol
    sight: >
      This appears to be an idol set in the middle of a fountain. The idol looks to be a figure of a large
      fish spewing water from its mouth. Uh, no. That's just one part of it, whatever it is, it stands about
      500 feet high. And whatever it is, someone has done a job on it...just look at that graffiti painted all
      over it! The water in the fountain seems to have not suffered from the effects of the vandalism, its
      waters seem to be a bit magical.
