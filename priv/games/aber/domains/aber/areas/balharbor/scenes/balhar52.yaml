      You are standing next to the alchemist shop which also turned back attempts to burn it down. The
      building to the north, wasn't so fortunate. Holes in the pavement can be seen everywhere from what looks
      to be caused from acid eating through it. You also notice some broken glass around those holes
      confirming that theory. Those angry people that tried so hard to set a building on fire on every single
      one of them on the block finally succeeded with a house to the north. You can marvel at their handiwork
      by going that way or head down Park Street to the east.
