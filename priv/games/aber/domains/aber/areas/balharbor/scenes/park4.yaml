    sight: >
      Several picnic tables are scattered around for people to sit and eat their lunches. If you brought your
      lunch, have a seat and chow! The tables look to be in fairly good shape and freshly painted--vandals
      must not have found these yet. The entrance to the park is south while the pond is to the east.
