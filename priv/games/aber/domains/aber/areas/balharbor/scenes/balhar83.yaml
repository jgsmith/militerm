    sight: >
      You take the plunge into the water and it feels nice now you have it all to yourself having gotten rid
      of the jerks that polluted that beach. The ocean is shallow for a great distance out to sea and you can
      swim all you like without fear of sinking of drowning--unless you try taking a nap out here. You can
      head back to shore to the south.
