    short: The Inn
    sight: >
      This serves as Bal Harbor's only inn. This building, small as it is, somehow is able to put up an
      unlimited number of guests at a time--so the vacancy sign is never taken down. The innkeeper housed
      several warriors who were passing through the day the riots started and they helped fend off the thugs
      attempting to tear down the place. Unfortunately they couldn't stay for long and soon the innkeeper had
      to deal with them himself. Thus this sacrificial pit was put in with a trapdoor attachment so that if he
      was threatened he could pull the lever and cause them to fall in. When you're fully rested, the exit is
      south. A temporary portal leads to the donation room, and familiar terrority.
