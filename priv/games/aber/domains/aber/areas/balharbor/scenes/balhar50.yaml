      You are standing outside the Thieves Guild, which seemed to have escaped any damage from rioters--mainly
      because the folks in this guild teach people the techniques of criminal activity. And what criminal
      wouldn't want to trash a place that teaches him how to be a crook? You can visit this place to the east
      or head north or south.
