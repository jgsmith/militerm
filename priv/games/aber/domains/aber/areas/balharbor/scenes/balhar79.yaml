    short: Western End of Dock
    sight: >
      You step to the western side of the dock, you get a somewhat clearer view of the docking bay for ships.
      Below, you can see a huge beach with a few hundred sunbathers and out in the water some surfers and
      swimmers. And there's a ladder here that will allow you to have a day at the beach, there's just one
      problem. The people below have taken notice of you and are watching to see if you come down the ladder.
      But why? Maybe you should check it out. There looks to be a sign here.
