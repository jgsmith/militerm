    short: Rotten Log
    sight: >
      You are walking on top of a rotten log lying across a creek underneath it. The log is hollow inside, but
      it seems strong enough to support your weight. The sun shines on a path west, and you can go deeper into
      the jungle to the east. You can follow the creek to the south.
