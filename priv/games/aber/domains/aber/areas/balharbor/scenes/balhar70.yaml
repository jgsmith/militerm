      How appropriate! This is exactly where the crooks in town hang out and sell their stolen goods to
      smuggle to other lands for profit. A dart board is set up in one corner of the room, where thieves can
      practice their dagger throwing. A window where a thief-clerk sits behind ready to pay for your fencing
      stolen stuff is in another corner. A wanted board lists the names of fellow thieves who got caught
      stealing but are still on the loose. Little else can be seen except the ladder leading back up into the
      guild.
