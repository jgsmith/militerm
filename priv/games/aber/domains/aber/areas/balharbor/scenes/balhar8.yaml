      In the back of the bar you see some fine wines stacked up on the rack. It's a bit more private and this
      is usually the place where dirty deals are struck to do jobs on people by mercenaries. A bulletin board
      hangs on the wall with a listing of all individuals wanted dead or alive...preferably dead. Some mean
      looking men wearing heavy armor and sharp deadly weapons can be seen sitting around at some
      booths--obviously waiting for someone to come in and hire them for a quick job. There is an empty one in
      the corner. The main part of the bar is back north.
