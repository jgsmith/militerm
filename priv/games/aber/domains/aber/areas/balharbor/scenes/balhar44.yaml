      You are standing next to the Mage Guild which can be entered to the west. Debris, scorchmarks, decay,
      death can be seen everywhere in front of this building. It looks like some rioters attempted to torch
      this place as well but were driven off by someone who blasted them with every fireball and missile spell
      he could muster. You might learn a trick or two from him if you pay him a visit.
