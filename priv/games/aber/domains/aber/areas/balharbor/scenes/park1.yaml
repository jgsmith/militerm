    sight: >
      Ah, there's nothing like getting away for the big city into a more peaceful area like the park! Unlike
      the torn apart city streets of Bal Harbor, this area outside of town seems to have escaped the
      destruction. A large sign next to the fence says "Moli`ere Park", welcoming visitors. Lust green grass
      covers this area and extends to the north and east.
