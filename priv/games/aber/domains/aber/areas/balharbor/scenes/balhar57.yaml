    sight: >
      There appears to be smoke and a lot of noise to the south. It looks to be a riot! You can see some angry
      thugs who set a building on fire and are throwing rocks and bottles. You can get right into the middle
      of it to the south or avoid it by going west or east. You can see some sort of arena to the north, but
      there's no entrance to it from this side.
