      What would be the perfect target after a riot has started? The bank of course! While the security force
      is busy beating down the rioters, a criminal gang can come in and perform a heist with very little
      resistance. And that's what seems to have happened. The vault door has been blown open with a bomb, and
      all the cash and valuables deposited in it has been plundered. The body of the bank manager along with a
      couple of tellers lie in the corner where they were ordered to lay down then shot to death. This
      disturbing scene can be left to the south.
