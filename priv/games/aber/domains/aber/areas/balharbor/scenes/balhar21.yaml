    sight: >
      You are standing on the west side of the idol. Debris can be seen strung about the street and
      smouldering piles of whatever it used to be as well. The faint smell of chemicals reaches your nose
      making your eyes water, and what appears to be some dead bodies makes it don on you that a nasty riot
      took place not too long ago. Exits run in all directions.
