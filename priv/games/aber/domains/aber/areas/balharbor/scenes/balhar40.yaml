    sight: >
      You have walked into the middle of a major disturbance where a band of thugs are smashing carriages,
      torching many buildings, and throwing stones and bottles toward the sash security force who are decked
      in full riot gear and shielding. Standing here too long would not be a good idea as the rioters may make
      you as a target. You can escape into the square to the west or head toward a large high wall to the
      north.
