      This is pretty much where the orders are given out. A man sitting behind a desk planning strategy,
      marking his battleplans, looking for spots where he can gain more effective control, exploit some
      unsuspecting rioters into things to gain an advantage...yet the guy is no pushover, he is a deadly
      fighter himself. The sooner he is taken out however, the faster the troops fall apart and go their
      separate ways leaderless.
