    sight: >
      Having successfully getting past the guards, you stand at the front door of the tower. If you can figure
      a way inside, you will have to figure out how to get up to the top without getting lost. You notice it's
      a lot darker here than it was below--it looks like it's gonna get a whole lot darker inside.
