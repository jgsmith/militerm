    sight: >
      You're at the top of the cliff, and what a view! I told you it would be worthwhile. You get a nice view
      of the small village and temples to the west, and the Yllythad Sea to the south. To the east you see the
      edge of a jungle, and all the sounds of it. Be ready to fight any jungle beasts.
