      Some children can be seen playing on the swings, the rockers, the merry-go-round, the monkeybars, and
      the slides. Most of the equipment here is fairly new and seems to have been built so even the "bigger"
      kids like you can use it. A pavilion where you can watch these kids play is to the north, and a place to
      watch the ducks swim around in the pond to the south and east.
