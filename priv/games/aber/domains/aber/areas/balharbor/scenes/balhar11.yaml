      Untouched by the riots this shop has many different weapons for sale. Swords, knives, daggers, and other
      sharp weapons line the walls. Since the owners of this shop had this large cache of blades and armor to
      use in a fight against the mob, the rioters and looters kept their distance in fear of being chopped to
      bits. If you got the cash you can buy a good weapon from this fellow at the counter. The square is back
      north, while the forge is to the east.
