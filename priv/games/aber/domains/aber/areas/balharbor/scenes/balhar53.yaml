    sight: >
      You're headed down Park Street in which some riot activity can be seen west of here and you can't help
      but notice a bit of smoke rising. A fenced in building which looks like a courthouse is to the south,
      but there's no door in from this side of it. Another building to the north is the side of the Cleric's
      Guild. The entrance is nearby to the east.
