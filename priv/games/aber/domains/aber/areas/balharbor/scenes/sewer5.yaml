    sight: >
      You seem to have entered someone's lair. Footprints and hacked walls can be seen everywhere. Looking
      around, you can see that a fight occurred here recently and the fighters must have taken a break and
      left their weapons lying around. Apparently their sansei won't be took happy when he finds out they left
      it and you took it.
