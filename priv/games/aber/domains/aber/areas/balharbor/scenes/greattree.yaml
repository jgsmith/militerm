    sight: >
      You are at the base of the trunk of an immense tree, at least twenty feet in diameter. The trunk is
      covered with vines, mosses and kudzu, which you could probably climb. Ancient roots stretch out across
      the leaf-covered forest floor. The dim sunlight filtering down through the leaves shows a path running
      east and west.
