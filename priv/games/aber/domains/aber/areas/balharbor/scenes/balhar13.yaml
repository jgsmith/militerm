      Untouched by the riots this shop has many different types of armor for sale. Shields, body armor, leg
      armor, and helmets line the walls. Since the owners of this shop had a large cache of armor and weapons
      to use in a fight against the mob, the rioters and looters kept their distance in fear of being chopped
      to bits. If you got the cash you can buy some armor from this fellow at the counter. The square is back
      north, while the forge is to the west.
