    short: Idol Square
    sight: >
      You are standing northeast of the idol. The town's only inn lies to the north where injured fighters or
      long-distance travelers can rest up before continuing their quests. The innkeeper who runs the inn
      single handedly fought attempts by rioters to trash his place by setting up a trap door on top of where
      a sacrificial pit was installed to sucker them into standing on top of it so he could throw the lever
      and cause them to fall into the voids. Those not falling for it the innkeeper grabbed thugs by their
      necks and throwing them into the pit. The square continues west and south. An angry crowd can be seen to
      the east where some things appear to be on fire.
