    sight: >
      Several large pipes stand here stuck in the floor, one on your left, one on your right, one in front,
      behind and above. You look inside them and see nothing but darkness below but HAVE to go somewhere. A
      picture on the wall features an Italian plumber entering a pipe. Hmm...Another pipe leads back to that
      lobby you started from.
