    short: The Adventurers Guild
    sight: >
      This guild is a hangout for numerous explorers and travelers who spent their lives exploring all distant
      lands. Now long since retired they spend their days telling younger ones of their exploits while sipping
      ale and beer at the bar toward the left side of the establishment. Come to think of it, you may be able
      to benefit by listening in to some of the stories being told here, that is, if the storytellers remain
      coherent enough. You can go back outside north or enter the back room to the south.
