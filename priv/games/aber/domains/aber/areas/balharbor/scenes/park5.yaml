    sight: >
      What would a park be without a pond that attracts water fowl? Here is a nice little pond where people
      can fish or feed the ducks and geese. It's somewhat too small to take a boat on it, it's easier to just
      walk around the perimeter. Already some ducks have gathered nearby quacking hoping you brought them some
      corn or bread crumbs to feed them with. A picnic area is to the west, and the front of the park to the
      south. Running water can be seen to the east and kids playing to the north.
