    short: South Entrance to the Coliseum
    sight: >
      You are standing at the south entrance to the Coliseum. There are citizens of Rome everywhere,
      apparently in a mad rush to get in. A &+Cstatue of Caligula&* the Mad Emperor overlooks the area. There
      are long &+Ylines&* of people standing to the east, an acrid smell is coming from the west and a busy
      road lies to the south.
