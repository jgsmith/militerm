    sight: >
      You are in a massive stone structure that has been designed to channel water into the city of Rome. Due
      to the recent drought, the water level is low, allowing passage without a boat. The walls and floor are
      covered with algae and slime, producing treacherous footing conditions. There are exits in all four
      cardinal directions.
