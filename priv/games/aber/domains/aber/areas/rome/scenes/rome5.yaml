    sight: >
      This used to be a gateway to and from western Rome. There is an iron &+ygate blocking your way. Judging
      by the amount of rust and foliage growing on the bars, it hasn't been open for years. Looking through
      the gate at the barren landscape that lies beyond, you can see why. A dirt &+yroad&* leads off to the
      east, and a store is directly south.
