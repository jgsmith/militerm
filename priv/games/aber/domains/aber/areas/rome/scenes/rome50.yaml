    sight: >
      You stand inside of a large courtroom in which common civil disputes and criminal matters are decided.
      There is a judge's bench and a witness stand on the far side of the room and a jury's box along side.
      The emperor's &+Mseal is prominently displayed on the wall behind the judge's &+ystand&*, reminding all
      who enter that he is an extension of his highness. There is a door, possibly leading to the judge's
      chambers, to the east and the waiting room is to the west.
