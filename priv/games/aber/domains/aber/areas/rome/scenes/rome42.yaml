      You are standing in the mage's shop. Magical ointments, charms and potions are sitting on shelves and
      behind a glass counter. There is a dense neon &+Bblue fog&* hugging the floor here, making it impossible
      to see below your knees. You suddenly hear muttering coming from the back room, possibly from ....
      KKKKKAAAAAAAABBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! You are deafened by the noise
      from a tremendous explosion and the concussion from the blast staggers you! The shopkeeper seems to pay
      no heed to this. The door to the back room opens and an older man, wearing a pointed hat, whose face is
      smudged with soot, sticks his head out. 'Is everyone alright? Sorry about that. I was testing a new
      mage's spell. I'll try to give advance notice next time,' he says. The door then closes.
