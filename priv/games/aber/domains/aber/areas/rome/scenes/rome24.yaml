    short: East Entrance to Coliseum
    sight: >
      You are standing at the east entrance to the Coliseum. There are people everywhere, apparently in a mad
      rush to get in. A &+Cstatue of Tiberius&*, an emperor of a time long since passed, stands here looking
      out over the crowd. There is a passage to the north, the ticket booth is to the south and a gate opening
      to the city lies to the east.
