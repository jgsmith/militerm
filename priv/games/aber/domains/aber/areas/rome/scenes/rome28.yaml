      You stand in a house, the size and splendor of which almost defies the imagination. The &+Cfloor&* is
      done with hand crafted marble tile with silver and jeweled inlays. The light coming through the
      exquisitely crafted stained glass &+Cwindows&* bathes the room in splendor and the &+Bfurniture&* looks
      as though it was made by master craftsmen from all over the empire. A path through the estate is north
      of here.
