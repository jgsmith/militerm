    short: The Common Seating
    sight: >
      This is where many of the common Roman citizens are seated during the games. These are the cheapest
      seats in the house, as glare from the sun is usually a problem during the afternoon. Like the other
      common seating areas, this place could stand extensive renovation and a thorough cleaning. This area
      extends to the south and a much more elegant seating area can be seen to the west.
