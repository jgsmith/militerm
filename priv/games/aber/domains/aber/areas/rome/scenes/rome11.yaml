      This is the place to come to if one is overcome by the heat and gore. (Or if a lion gets loose.) You see
      a jar of live &+Rleeches&* and other barbaric medical apparatus lying about here. From the west comes
      the roar of the crowd, and a hall leads east. The doctor will be with you shortly.
