      You are now so high up that you begin to feel lightheaded and your nose feels like it is going to start
      bleeding. There aren't even benches to sit on here; just bare dirty stone. The view of the surrounding
      &+gcountry&* is spectacular. Unfortunately you can barely see the playing field. There is a set of steps
      here, leading down.
