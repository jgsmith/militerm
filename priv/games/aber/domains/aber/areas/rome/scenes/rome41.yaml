    sight: >
      You are in a massive stone structure that has been designed to channel water into the city of Rome. Due
      to the recent drought, the water level is low, allowing passage without a boat. The walls and floor are
      covered with algae and &+Gslime&* producing treacherous footing conditions. There are exits to the
      north, south and east.
