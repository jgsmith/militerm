      You are on a platform overlooking a massive aquaduct. There is a &+ctelescope mounted to the railing
      that surrounds the area and you can hear the gurgle of water as it is channeled into the city. Off in
      the distance, you can see the Mountain of the Gods. There is a &+Csign&* mounted to the railing and a
