      PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-YEEEEEWWWWWWWW!!!!! Boy does it stink in here!!! You taste bile in your mouth and your
      eyes begin to water. As you wipe away your tears, you see that this is a small room, in the far corner
      of which a &+yhole&* is dug. The odor intensifies as you move closer and there is a &+Croll of toilet
      paper sitting on the ground. The only exit is to the west and your nose and stomach are strongly
      suggesting that you use it.
