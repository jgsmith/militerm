      Welcome to the weaponshop of Titus Andronicus!! Rare halberds, whips, &+Cswords and other instruments of
      death are proudly displayed on the walls and in gleaming glass cases. More common weapons are stacked
      like wood on the floor. To the north you can barely make out a gate. There is a very secure looking door
      to the south.
