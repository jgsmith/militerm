    short: Mobiles And Combat
    sight: >
      Mobiles, or non-playing characters, are your adversaries in this game. Some are there to help you, but
      most are ripe for the killing. Beware though, some may be tougher or better-armed than you, so it is
      advisable to find out how strong a mobile is before attacking it. To do this, use the &+CEXAMINE
      command, or &+CEX&* for short, followed by the name of the mobile. This will tell you how tough it is.
      To attack a mobile called 'Troll' type &+RKILL TROLL&*. For every mob you slay, you gain points. If you
      &+CFLEE&* from a mob, you lose points. Sometimes you have to &+CFLEE&* to stay alive. The mobiles regain
      their strength here, meaning you can't damage them, run away, heal, and return to finish them off.
