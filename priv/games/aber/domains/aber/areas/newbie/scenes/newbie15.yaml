      A world cannot be created without a creator, and we have such figures looking over the world. This
      chamber however contains a pagan god, an idol that doesn't exist but was put here to demostrate what to
      do if you happen to find the temples where they reside. Call this idol, the PAGAN. To find out how you
      should interact with a god, &+YINFO RELIGION&* will give you the guide to perform the proper rituals.
      The END OF THE TOUR is to the south of you.
