      When you enter dark areas, you need to have something that is lit, glowing, or can be lighted. Before
      you can light an item like a torch, you may have to find something to light something else. There is a
      fire in this room, and you have an unlit torch, type &+YLIGHT TORCH&*. To put it out, you can type
      &+YUNLIGHT TORCH&* or &+YEXTINGUISH TORCH&*. Sometimes you will need to eat or drink food to quelsh your
      hunger and thrist and keep your strength up in the heat of battle. Here is a pot of hot coffee, you
      would type &+GDRINK COFFEE&*. Here is a bowl of salad, take it for when you are hungry, where you would
      type &+GEAT SALAD&*. Carry food with you when you explore the land, it comes in handy. You can cross a
      bridge north, or sail back out east.
