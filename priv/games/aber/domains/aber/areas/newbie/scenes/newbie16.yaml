      Some rooms can also be over water, underwater, or in the sky. You will need to find something that
      allows you to travel to these places. You brought along a boat with you, so you were able to enter here
      without having to swim. Later on, you will need scuba gear to swim underwater, or wings to fly in the
      sky. Be careful that you don't lose your boat while on water, or you will drown. Some rooms are also too
      dark to see in or are dark during the night, of which you need to have an object to light up the room.
      An island is to the west of you, or you can climb up on the bank upwards.
