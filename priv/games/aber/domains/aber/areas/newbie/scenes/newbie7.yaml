    short: Weapons And Armor
    sight: >
      If you didn't already know, the Promised Land is a dangerous place. And as you run around the world
      saving princesses and finding treasure, fighting with your bare hands isn't your best option. The key to
      survival is equipping yourself with weapons and armor. Armor can take many forms, and the more pieces
      you are wearing, the better you will be protected. You can only wield one weapon at a time, but some
      weapons are better than others. The equipment provided here is fairly good, but it is for new players
      only - use it to try to find where to find good equipment elsewhere on the mud. You can come back again
      and again to take this stuff until you reach level 6. To use this weapon, type &+YWIELD NEWBIESWORD&*,
      and to use the armor, type &+YWEAR NEWBIEARMOR&*. If you are carrying a lot of clothes, you can put them
      all on at once using the &+YWEARALL&* command--granted that aren't wearing something else there. To see
      what equipment you are using and how much protection and power you have, type &+YEQUIPMENT&* or just
      &+YEQ&*.
