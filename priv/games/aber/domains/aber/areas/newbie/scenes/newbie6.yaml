    short: Scavenging for Items
    sight: >
      You will come across many items as you progress through the mud. Some will be useful to you; others will
      not. You can only carry a certain number of items, but you will soon get a feel for what you need and
      what you do not. Pick up items using the command &+GGET&* or &+GTAKE&*. Drop them again using the
      command &+GDROP&*. To see what you are carrying at any time, type &+YI&* or &+YINV&* for
      &+YINVENTORY&*). You can practice these commands on the towel in this room. There may be something
      interesting about the object, so you should use the &+CEXAMINE&* command, or &+CEX&* for short, followed
      by the name of the object. There are many types of items, some of which you will come across shortly.
      The path takes a turn here, to continue the tour, go west.
