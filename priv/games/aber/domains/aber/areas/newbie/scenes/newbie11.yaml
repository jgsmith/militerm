      The object of this game is to make Wizard. If you are new to MUDs, that will be challenging enough. If
      you are an experienced player, however, you might like a greater challenge. We have worked to find
      handicaps which leave the game challenging and not tedious. The handicap levels are &+CSTANDARD&*,
      &+CFAMED&* and &+CGREAT&*. To find out the handicap conditions type &+BHANDICAP <level>&*. What you get
      from playing with a handicap is greater recognition. The users and who commands will show your handicap,
      and if you make it to wizard, you will be a 'Famedwizard' or a 'Greatwizard'. All the wizards have a
      core of capabilities, but Famedwizards and Greatwizards have a few extras. Mostly it is the recognition
      of a more difficult achievement. You cannot take a handicap if you have learned the fence skill, solved
      any quests, killed 40 or more mobs, or have ever advanced beyond level 4. The *only* location in which
      the handicap command is active is this room. Accumulating experience suggests that even experienced
      players will make critical strategic mistakes in building their first character. On the standard
      handicap you have enough income to correct this, so you should probably not take a handicap if this is
      your first character here.
