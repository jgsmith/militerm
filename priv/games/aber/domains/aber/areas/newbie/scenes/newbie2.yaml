      To move between rooms you type in a direction. The available directions are &+YNORTH&*, &+YSOUTH&*,
      &+YWEST&*, &+YEAST&*, &+YUP&*, &+YDOWN&*, and &+YNE&*, &+YNW&*, &+YSE&*, &+YSW&*. From here you can go
      &+YSOUTH&* by typing the word itself or just the first letter '&+MS&*'. You can also type '&+YGO&*'
      (move randomly). To find out what exits you can use from the room you are standing in and get some clues
      as to where they lead, you can type &+YEXITS&* or just &+YEXI&*. If you want to automatically see the
      exits as you enter a new room, type &+YAUTOEXIT&*. (Type it again to turn off this feature.) To get help
      at any time, type &+BHELP&* and &+BHELP HELP&*.
