      If you wish everyone on the mud to hear what you say, you can use the command &+YSHOUT <MESSAGE>&*. But
      avoid using it when you can use TELLs or SAYs. If you wanted to send a message to just all the wizards
      on the game, you can use the &+YWISH MESSAGE&* command, . A better way to talk to everyone is the
      &+YCHAT&* command. Chatting a lot will not offend people, because everyone has the ability to switch off
      the chat line. To do this type &+YNOCHAT&*. To switch the chat line back on again, simply type
      &+YNOCHAT&* again. There are other chatlines available, including &+YGCHAT&*, and &+YABERCHAT&*. The
      other help commands are listed in the HELP command. The tour continues to the south.
