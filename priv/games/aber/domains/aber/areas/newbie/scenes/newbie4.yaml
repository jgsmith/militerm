    sight: >
      There are many ways to communicate with the people on this mud. If you wish to talk to somebody directly
      without anyone else hearing, use the &+YTELL command. For example if you wish to say hello to a player
      called Dave, type: &+Ytell Dave hello&+w Usually the word &+YTELL&* is not necessary - you could also
      type: &+YDave hello You can also type &+CREPLY MESSAGE&* to respond to a most previous tell. If you are
      in the same room as other people and you wish to say something which they can all hear, use the &+YSAY
      MESSAGE&* command. For example, type: &+YSAY Hi guys! What's new? You can also do&+Y 'Hi guys! What's
      new? &*with a single quote in place of &+YSAY&*. Next, we tell you how to communicate with the world.
