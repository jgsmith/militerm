    sight: >
      This is a very thick part of the forest. The trees are not noticeably closer together, but their foliage
      is less dense and thus more light reaches the ground here than did in the forest across the river. The
      effect of this is that the undergrowth flourishes, producing vast and rambling forms that obstruct you
      at every turn. To the south the way back to the river is easy enough, while to the east you think you
      can manage to squeeze through the bushes.
