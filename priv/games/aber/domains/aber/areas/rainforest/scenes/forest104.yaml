    sight: >
      You are standing before a high stone wall, overgrown with creeping plants. It is a relic of an ancient
      civilisation, though judging from the rather poor quality of the workmanship the race that built it were
      not THAT civilised... However it is a comforting sign of a human presence in this vast and mainly
      unexplored forest. It blocks your way south and east.
