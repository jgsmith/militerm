    sight: >
      In this drier part of the forest many species of butterfly are swarming. Some settle on your face and
      arms and lick off your sweat with their long probosces, hungry for salt. Some of the others are huge,
      almost a foot across, but those tend to stay away from you. Their wingbeats are distinctly audible.
