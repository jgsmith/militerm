    short: Hardwood Trees
    sight: >
      You are struck by how many different species of trees populate this forest. In this spot you count
      several tall hardwood varieties, with tall unbranching trunks that make them valuable for timber.
      Lapachos, curapays and spanish cedars are notable amongst them, but there are many more that you do not
      recognise. There are exits in all directions.
