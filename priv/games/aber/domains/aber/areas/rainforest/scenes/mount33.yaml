    sight: >
      You are standing atop a pass at the eastern edge of the mountain range. Before you, thousands of feet
      below, a sea of trees extends to the horizon. A narrow path leads from here to a rocky lip, from where a
      path begins to descend steeply, dropping quickly out of your view. To the west is a large snowfield.
