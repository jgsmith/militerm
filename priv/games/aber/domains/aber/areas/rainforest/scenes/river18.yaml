    sight: >
      You are still a long way from the shore here, although you realise that if you go much nearer you would
      bring yourself within range of Indian arrows. To your astonishment you see a small ocean-going ship
      perched atop one of the trees some way in from the shoreline. You cannot imagine how it got there.
