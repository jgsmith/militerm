    sight: >
      You are wading through tea-coloured water, your feet fortunately on firm sand rather than thick yielding
      mud. The water is cool and pleasant, and comes as a relief in the humid heat of the jungle. A tall tree
      has fallen into the river to the west, and you prefer to ignore that direction rather than wading in
      deeper to try to get around it.
