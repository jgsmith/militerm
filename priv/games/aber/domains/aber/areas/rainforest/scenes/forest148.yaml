    sight: >
      You are in the middle of a tiny Indian village, surrounded by a cluster of huts arranged in a rough
      circle. To the west and north a solid wall of trees marks the edge of the forest, and it looks
      impenetrable at this point. To the south you could climb back down the slope to the river.
