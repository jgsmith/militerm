    sight: >
      You are at the top of a cliff, where the Kerapi river pours over the brink and drops in one unbroken
      waterfall down a full five hundred feet to crash in huge clouds of spray at the bottom, whence it calms
      down and begins to crawl eastward at a far more leisurely pace.
