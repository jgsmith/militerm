    short: Where The Hummingbirds Hum
    sight: >
      This part of the forest has a quiet, ethereal quality. You are on high ground within sight of the river,
      where tall plants abound with deep flowers whose nectar only hummingbirds can reach. Several of those
      tiny birds are hovering around here, their humming increasing in pitch every time they move. You can go
      east and west from here.
