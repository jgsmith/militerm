    short: Fig Tree
    sight: >
      You are standing at the base of a strangling fig, which started life as a seedling growing on the trunk
      of another tree. As the fig grew it came to dominate its host, wrapping its branches around it and
      choking it, until the tree within was dead and the fig strong enough to stand alone. You can go in any
      direction.
