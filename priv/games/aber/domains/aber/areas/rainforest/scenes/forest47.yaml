    short: Entrance To The Burrow
    sight: >
      You are in a relatively open part of the forest. The canopy overhead is particularly thick and, perhaps
      because of this, the ground is fairly free of ground plants. There is a burrow here, about eighteen
      inches across, and you wonder what kind of animal might have made it.
