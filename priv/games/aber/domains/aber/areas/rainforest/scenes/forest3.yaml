    sight: >
      You are standing on the southern bank of an angry, and voluble, young river which is flowing very
      rapidly eastwards. At this point it is some thirty feet wide. Out in the middle of the river torrent
      ducks plunge into the water, struggling to swim underwater against the current, making their way from
      rock to rock, plucking stonefly larvae from the weed clinging there.
