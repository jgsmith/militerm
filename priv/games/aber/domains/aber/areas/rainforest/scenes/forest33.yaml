    sight: >
      You are up in the canopy. Looking up, you can see the sky, but in every other direction all you can see
      are leaves. The tree you are in is one of the particularly competitive species which tower up into the
      sky, its top high above the canopy. You could probably climb it if you had a mind to. Otherwise you can
      descend to the ground or move across the branches into another tree.
