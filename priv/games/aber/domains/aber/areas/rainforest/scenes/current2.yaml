      You inevitably come to the end of the trees and then pass by a succession of varied shorelines, the
      climate gradually becoming more and more temperate. After what seems like an age, you begin to spot
      familiar landmarks. Over to the northwest is the volcano Mount Bandilbar, presiding over a verdant
      landscape. As you slowly draw level with it you see the mountains surrounding the blizzard pass and,
      closer to you, the long stretch of shoreline to the east of the village. Ramshackle but comfortingly
      familiar, the Old Seadog looms closer and you sigh as you finally feel you have come home at last. The
      cold southern current is now so weak as to be unnoticeable, and only your momentum carries you the last
      half mile to the waters just east of the jetty.
