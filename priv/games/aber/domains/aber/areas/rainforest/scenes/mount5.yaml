    sight: >
      Once a stream flowed through here, and perhaps still does, at those times of year when the rain is most
      intense. Yet for now this gully is as dry as a bone, and you can make good use of it as a path leading
      down to the south, into a sheltered v-shaped valley. Alternatively you can clamber up the eastward slope
      which is less steep than those to the north and west.
