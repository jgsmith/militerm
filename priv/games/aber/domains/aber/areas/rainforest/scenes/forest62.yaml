      You are in the middle of a dense thicket. There is a faint smell of honey in the air and you notice bees
      swarming around a hole in one of the tree trunks here. The odour makes your mouth water but you are
      acutely aware that you are in killer bee country and you dare not risk upsetting these creatures.
