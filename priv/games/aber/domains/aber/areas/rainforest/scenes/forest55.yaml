    sight: >
      You are perched on the top of a high rock, a boulder perhaps, brought down from the mountains in an
      ancient time of ice when glaciers reached down even to this level. From this vantage point you can see
      quite a long way down the river to the east, but unfortunately you are not high enough to see over the
      tops of the trees. A vertical drop off the rock to the west means that you will have to head back east.
