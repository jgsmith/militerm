    sight: >
      You are in a deep part of the rainforest. Hardwoods of varying sizes climb up to the canopy here, some
      breaking through to better harvest the light. One variety appears to have strange knobbly spikes
      sticking out of its trunk, giving it a peculiar prickly appearance. The undergrowth is too thick to the
      west for you to progress in that direction, but on all other sides the way is clear.
