    sight: >
      You are up to your knees in water. A number of narrow channels run off from the sides of the lagoon to
      join the river to the south. Since you know there is also a river close by to the north, you begin to
      feel somewhat hemmed in. To the north a dense cluster of swamp-living trees bars your way.
