    sight: >
      You are to some extent protected here by a great outthrust mass of rock which looms threateningly over
      you. Yet it is not about to fall and you pause here to consider which route to take next. You could
      continue along the gully, following it up to the north or down to the south, or you could investigate a
      small cave to the west.
