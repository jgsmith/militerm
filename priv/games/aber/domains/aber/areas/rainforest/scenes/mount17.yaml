    sight: >
      You are not actually on the summit here, for the final haul up to the top is almost sheer. The topmost
      fifty feet is scored by a series of vertical grooves, and it is in one of these that you are now
      sheltering, for in the more exposed areas the temperature is just too bitter to endure. The only way you
      see going from here is back down to the shoulder. The clouds seem awfully thick around here, enough to
      climb on.
