    short: Crossing The Glacier
    sight: >
      You are making your way across the glacier. At times the ice creaks ominously beneath your feet, but so
      far it seems to be holding. To the south the ice looks more broken and you feel a sense of unease when
      you contemplate that route. Further downstream to the east it looks even worse. The ice to the west
      looks more stable, but by far the safest exit is that to the north, where the moraine promises surer
      ground.
