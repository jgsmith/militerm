    sight: >
      You are facing a high wall made of hard dry mud. Numerous holes have been delved into the cliff and many
      brightly-coloured macaws are flying in and out of them. The racket they are making with their inelegant
      cries sets your teeth on edge. You are unable to climb the wall as the parakeets mob you when you come
      too close. You will have to return north.
