    sight: >
      You are in the middle of a snowfield, sinking up to your knees in fresh snow. Your fingers and toes are
      numb. Ice is forming on your eyebrows and you long to get back down into the warm. To the east the
      ground just rises and rises up to the top of a high pass, while to the north the ground just ends at a
      cliff wall which descends to meet a wide glacier.
