      You are deep within the rainforest. As you pause here you become aware of an at first intriguing, then
      after a while intensely annoying, sound. It sounds as if an anvil is repeatedly being struck by an
      hammer. The noise is the call of the bell bird, and it will happily spend all day sitting on its branch
      high above you doing nothing else but make this strange sound. After a short time it begins to irritate
      you and you become keen to move on.
