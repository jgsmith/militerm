    short: End Of The Inlet
    sight: >
      You are at the southern end of a narrow inlet which runs north from here towards the river. Several
      species of tree grow from under the water, and some more of the same grow in the surrounding area. These
      are not tall trees but they bear small red fruit which fall into the water at intervals while you watch.
      You can go in any direction.
