    sight: >
      The roof of the palace, unfortunately, has caved in under centuries of battling against the elements.
      However, there is much here to please the eye and you spend some time looking around the wonderful
      statues and wall carvings, many of which are either of solid gold or covered with gold leaf. This was
      once an unbelievably opulent race and you wonder what can have happened to bring it to such an end.
