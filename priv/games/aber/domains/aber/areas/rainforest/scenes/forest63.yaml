    sight: >
      There is a smell of rotting vegetation here. You try to take stock of your surroundings but you are
      constantly plagued by clouds of mosquitos. What is worse, you are thigh-deep in water and in your
      tortured imagination you come to believe that a host of leeches is now feeding on your legs. To the
      north and east is deeper water, so you resolve to head in a drier direction.
