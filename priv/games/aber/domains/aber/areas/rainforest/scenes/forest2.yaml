    sight: >
      You are entirely surrounded by tall trees with slender trunks which reach up high in search of light. A
      hundred feet above you they branch out into a vast green canopy, blocking out nearly all of the sun's
      rays. Long creepers and lianas climb the tree trunks, while others hang free to dangle on the forest
      floor. To the north you hear the rushing of a youthful river.
