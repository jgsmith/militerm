    short: Stuck In The Fig Forest
    sight: >
      You are lost, deep in the fig forest. The only trees you can see here are strangler figs. Through some
      quirk of nature, they have come to completely dominate this part of the rainforest and will allow no
      other trees to grow. There are exits in all directions, though everywhere you look seems to be dark and
      gloomy.
