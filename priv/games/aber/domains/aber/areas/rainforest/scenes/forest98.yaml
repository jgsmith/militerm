    sight: >
      You are in an open part of the forest. Far above your head the canopy forms a roof through which only a
      small proportion of the sun's light penetrates. Much closer to the ground is the understorey, comprising
      short saplings and palms which are adapted to the dim light conditions. You can go anywhere except west,
      where a tall buttress-rooted kapok blocks your way.
