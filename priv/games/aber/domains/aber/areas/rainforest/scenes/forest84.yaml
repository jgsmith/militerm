    short: Under The Kapok Tree
    sight: >
      A terrible smell assaults your nostrils as you pause at the base of an enormous kapok tree. You
      discover, nestling between the tall thin roots of the tree, a huge flower, at least a foot across, which
      is giving off the most incredibly noxious odour. It is a stinking corpse flower and well deserves its
      name.
