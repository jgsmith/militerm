    sight: >
      The temple is truly beautiful inside. Much of the splendour has of course been looted in the past, but
      what remains still impresses you with its glory. Carven godly images stand along the walls and nestle
      within alcoves while at the front a sacrificial altar, though arousing your distaste, still contrives to
      instil in you a grudging admiration at its design. The only exit is to the south.
