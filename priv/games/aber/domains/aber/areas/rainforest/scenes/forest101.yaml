      You are in a curious arrangement of trees: an avenue running from east to west. On either side of the
      avenue are tall kapok trees which reach high above the canopy, collecting a great deal of the sun's
      light. Why they have grown in such a fashion though is a mystery. It does not seem to be have occurred
      naturally. But if somebody planted them, then whom? And why?
