    sight: >
      At the bottom of the waterfall the noise is terrific and you cover your ears to protect them. You
      quickly become soaked with the spray from the river and resolve to hasten out of this area forthwith. To
      the south you could head into the forest, or you could follow the river as it wends its way east.
