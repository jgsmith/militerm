    sight: >
      You have come upon the kind of terrain leeches love best. And in this humid jungle the leeches are of
      staggering sizes. However the large ones are easy to cope with; it is the small ones that get inside
      your clothes that you are most concerned about. You continually have to stop and pluck them from your
      body, and that is not always easy... their suction-cup mouths grip you with surprising strength.
