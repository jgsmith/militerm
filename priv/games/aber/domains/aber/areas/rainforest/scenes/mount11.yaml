    short: Steep Slope
    sight: >
      You are struggling to maintain your balance on a steep and scree-covered slope from which you can look
      down upon a young river rushing past below you. You will be able to descend to its edge, but the
      gradient of the slope and the presence of the ever-slipping scree prohibits an ascent.
