    sight: >
      You are up in the canopy. Here on the spreading branches many plants make their home which you would
      normally think of as belonging on the ground. Orchids and other epiphytes make use of their hosts in
      order to catch the sun's rays which are too rare on the dim forest floor below. You can descend to the
      ground or move across the branches into another tree.
