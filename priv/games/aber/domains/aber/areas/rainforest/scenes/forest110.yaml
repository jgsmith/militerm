    short: Totally Fatal Quicksand Deathtrap
    sight: >
      You plunge suddenly into quicksand! Before you can react you have sunk up to your thighs in the
      treacherous mix of sand and water. There, however, you stop. The quicksand is not deep and you are able
      to extricate yourself quite easily, counting yourself very lucky as you do so. You have no doubt that to
      a small animal this quicksand would indeed be totally fatal.
