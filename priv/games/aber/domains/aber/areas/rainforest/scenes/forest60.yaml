      You blink as you enter a glade in the forest, where the sudden brightness dazzles you for a moment. You
      realise how little light penetrates the canopy in the heart of the forest around you. You cannot see a
      reason for the absence of trees in this area, and all around you the trees are plentiful. To the south
      they crowd together so much as to make heading in that direction rather impractical.
