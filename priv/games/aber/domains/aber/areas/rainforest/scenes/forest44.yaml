    sight: >
      Here stands a tall tree which is marked with several small holes. Ants pour out of the holes at the
      first sign of an intruder. The ants appear to share a curious symbiotic relationship with the tree,
      protecting it against marauding insects and other small animals, while the tree in turn provides a home
      for its guards. There are exits in every direction.
