    sight: >
      You are wandering through the heart of the rainforest. The density of the trees makes it impossible to
      continue in a straight line and you wonder whether you might be going round in circles. Long lianas
      climbing up the nearby tree trunks would help you to ascend into the canopy if you wished. There are
      exits in all directions.
