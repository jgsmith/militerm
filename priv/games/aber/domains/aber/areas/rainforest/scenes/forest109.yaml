    sight: >
      You are on the bank of the river, overshadowed by a clump of trees which reach out over the water,
      dropping into it red berries from time to time, where they are quickly snapped up by fish darting up
      from the bottom. Such fish will carry the seeds for miles up or down the river where they will deposit
      them to grow at the water's edge. Thus do these fruit trees propagate. You try a berry experimentally
      but find the taste highly unpleasant.
