    sight: >
      You are floating on the river Kerapi. On either side of you are tree-lined banks, fairly close to each
      other at this point. The water is pale brown with churned-up mud and flows swiftly downstream, carrying
      you with it. There is no way that you will be able to head upstream, so you will have to accept your
      fate.
