    short: Gully Bottom
    sight: >
      You have come to the bottom end of a narrow gully which in rainy seasons pours water from the upper
      slopes to the north into the river valley below you. A small river, ice cold and greenish from glacier
      meltwater, flows past along the valley floor. You can head back up the gully or follow the valley east
      or west from here.
