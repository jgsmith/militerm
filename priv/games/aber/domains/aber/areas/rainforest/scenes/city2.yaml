    sight: >
      You gasp in awe as you stand in the centre of what must once have been an incredibly beautiful city.
      While not actually made of gold, the city must nevertheless have been extremely rich in the precious
      metal. Around you the buildings and many statues and sculptures all show signs of having once been
      plated with gold leaf, and flashes of golden light from flakes on the ground constantly catch your eye.
      To the north is a massive temple, not a subtle affair perhaps, but nevertheless a construction of great
      majesty. To the west is a proud and kingly statue standing tall in the middle of the square. And to the
      south, most magnificent of all, a palace of ancient kings towers into the sky.
