    sight: >
      Technically speaking, this is the River Kerapi, which has just been joined by the Malazon flowing in
      from the south-west. For some time henceforward, the water from the two rivers flows side by side, the
      difference in colour rather striking. The river is too fast-moving for you to try to head back upstream,
      but you may be able to reach the northern or southern shore with some strenuous paddling.
