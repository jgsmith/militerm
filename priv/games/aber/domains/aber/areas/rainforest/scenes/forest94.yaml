      The forest floor here is clear, and the thin layer of leaf litter firm under your feet. In the subpolar
      forests a pine needle may take seven years to decay; a fallen oak leaf in a temperate forest will
      disappear in a year or so, yet in these humid conditions any leaf that falls will have completely rotted
      away within six weeks. As you study the leaf litter you see thousands of tiny fungi toiling at the
      process of decay.
