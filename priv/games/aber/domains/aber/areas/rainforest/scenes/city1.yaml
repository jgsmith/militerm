    sight: >
      You have come upon a high archway made of stone but overlaid with gold leaf in some places. Mostly it
      has all flaked off but your spirits are undaunted. Could this be the secret entrance to the legendary
      city of El Dorado? You can go through the archway to the west or head out into the forest to the east.
