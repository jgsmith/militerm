    sight: >
      The bank ends suddenly here, cut through by a long inlet that runs through the trees to the south.
      Crossing it would be almost impossible, since it is riddled with tree roots and trunks growing up from
      the mud at the bottom of the inlet. You can turn south along the bank of the inlet or head west along
      the river bank.
