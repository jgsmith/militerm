      You are up to your knees in muddy water. Every step is an effort and the sweat pours from your face.
      Thousands of tiny little biting flies swarm over your skin, making your life a misery. You slap your
      face and kill some fifty of them, but as soon as you remove your hand another fifty take their place.
      You struggle on in the hope of finding a more hospitable area.
