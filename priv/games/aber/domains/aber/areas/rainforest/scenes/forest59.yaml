    sight: >
      Here the ground dips a little, and you find yourself splashing through water which comes halfway up your
      shins. The going is slow, and every time you lift up a foot, it breaks free of the water with a sucking
      noise - there is mud beneath. Looking east you can see more of the same kind of ground, but it is drier
      to the west.
