    sight: >
      You are in a deep part of the forest where only a little light reaches the ground. An enormous stone
      statue stands here, partially crumbled but still imposing. It appears to be a god of some kind, and its
      terrible eyes are intact and manage to convey a sense of awesome power. Whether the race who carved it
      is still flourishing somewhere in the heart of the rainforest, you have no idea.
