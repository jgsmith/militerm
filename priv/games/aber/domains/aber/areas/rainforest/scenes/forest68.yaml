    short: Ant Trail
    sight: >
      The forest floor is covered with leaves and twigs, and across this litter marches a long line of large
      ants. The trail consists of several lines of one- way traffic, flanked by defensive soldiers patrolling
      the borders. You are careful not to get too close, for they can give a very painful bite and tend to
      attack by the hundred.
