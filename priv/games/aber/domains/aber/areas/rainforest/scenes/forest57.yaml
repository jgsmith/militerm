    sight: >
      You are at the edge of a wide strip of sand, constantly lapped by the water and no doubt frequently
      submerged. For now though it appears to be a place where caimans rest, and as you arrive a few of them
      slide into the water, hopefully considering you too large to be easy prey. At this point the river bends
      gently round to the south as it goes downstream, so if you continue east you will be heading into the
      jungle. North will also take you into thicker growth, while to the west you can follow the bank up the
      river again.
