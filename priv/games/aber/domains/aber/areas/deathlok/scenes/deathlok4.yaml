    sight: >
      After leaving the stoned pathway, you reach the mountain base. Before you lies a large dark mountain
      filled with unknown danger. Looking up into the mountain you realize that the voyage up will be a
      dangerous one. Journeying up into the mountain will be a quest by itself. From this point you can see
      treacherous ledges, ravines, cliffs and all sorts of trouble. Slowly, you begin to wonder if going up
      into the mountain would be worth the time and trouble.
