    short: Mountain Pathway
    sight: >
      Once into the mountain you reach a mountain pathway that leads up to the mountain peak. Before lies a
      narrow path leading to a ledge. Looking around you notice that the path has not been used for years or
      even decades. You notice that underbrush has grown around the path making the path difficult to see. To
      the north of you lies a treacherous ledge. To the south, leads back down to the mountain base.
