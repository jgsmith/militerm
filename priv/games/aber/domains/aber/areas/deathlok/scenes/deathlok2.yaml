      Following the path, you notice that the road leads further north. Looking down the road, you see a large
      ominous mountain. In the background, you notice dark clouds that encircle the mountain. Suddenly, you
      realize that this must be the legendary mountain where the infinity is told to exist. To the north, the
      path continues up to the mountain. To the south, the path leads back down.
