    short: Stoned Pathway
    sight: >
      Leaving the main road, you come to a stoned pathway, leading up to the mountains. Examining the path,
      you notice that the road is paved with skulls. Slowly, you realize that this pathway is an entryway into
      a dark land. You see two exits from this path, one to the north and one to the south. To the north, the
      path continues up into the mountains. To the south the path leads back to Humpbacked Bridge.
