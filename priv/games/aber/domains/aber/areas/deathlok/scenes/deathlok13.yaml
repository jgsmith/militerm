    sight: >
      You have just reached the Chamber of Death. Entry into Death's chamber means ultimate destruction by her
      deadly touch. Looking around you see nothing, but everything that you have witnessed in your sad and
      pityful life. The walls here are just black as well as the floor and ceiling. Exits from this point are
      to the north and to the east.
