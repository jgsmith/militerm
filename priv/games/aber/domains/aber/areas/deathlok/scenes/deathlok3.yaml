      Before you is the end of the pathway. Gazing around you notice that the road ends at this point. From
      where the road leads now, is a mystery. Looking up into the moutains, you see a lightning storm that has
      hit the peak of the mountain. To the north you can see the moutain base. To the south you see the
      pathway lead back to the bridge.
