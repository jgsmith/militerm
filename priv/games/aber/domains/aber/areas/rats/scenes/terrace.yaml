    sight: >
      You are standing in a room which was once a terrace, but someone found it not good to have a terrace, so
      walls were built and a new room was created. This room is supposedly a relaxing room for Mom, because
      there is a sewing-machine and a lot of textile and style magazines. Maybe you shouldn't move anything,
      because people owning a room like this have mostly an organized chaos in their items.
