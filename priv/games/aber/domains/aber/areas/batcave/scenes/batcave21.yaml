    sight: >
      You've reached the deepest heart of the cavern's network. You must be hundreds of meters beneath the
      surface. And yet, this is surely one of the most beautiful rooms you've seen in a long long time.
      Hundreds of &+Ycandles burn quietly. Potted plants hang from stalactites carved to resemble figures.
      Scattered &+ystalagmites&* likewise have been carved to resemble all manner of fantastical creatures:
      most look like men and women with the heads of animals; all wear distinctly Egyptian garb. &+CFrescos&*
      cover parts of the walls, while magnificent &+Mmosaics&* brilliantly portray ancient scenes of Egyptian
      life.
