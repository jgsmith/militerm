    sight: >
      You are standing in an old laboratory that seems to have been abandoned long ago. A few bats cling to
      the ceiling, and their droppings cover much of the equipment. There are machines with blinking lights
      everywhere, along with strange objects you cannot even begin to understand. In the center of the giant
      room is a black metal chariot of some sort. Off to the west you hear a low moaning sound, but all you
      hear is quiet to the east.
