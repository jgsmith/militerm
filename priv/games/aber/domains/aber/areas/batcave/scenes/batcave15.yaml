    sight: >
      You've reached a cavern so deep you can feel the air pressure in your eardrums. Stalactites and
      stalagmites are so large and numerous here, their tips beginning to merge in most cases, that you feel
      you are in a room of columns. Or a limestone forest. To the north you catch a glimpse of a doorway
      obviously carved by hand. The floor of the entryway is splattered with dried blood. The openings to the
      east and west feel more inviting.
