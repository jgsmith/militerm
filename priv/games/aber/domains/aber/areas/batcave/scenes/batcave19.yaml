    sight: >
      This chamber possesses a feeling of overwhelming age. It feels as though the steps, carved doorways,
      polished floor were all made the same time as the cavern itself formed. It simply feels impossibly old,
      and though it is not a very large chamber, and is very plain, its unimaginable age makes you feel
      suddenly very insignificant. The only objects are two burning oil &+Ylamps&* on either side of a pair of
      doors.
