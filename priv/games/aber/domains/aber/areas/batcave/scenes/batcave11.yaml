    sight: >
      Not the wood-paneled den you expected after the parlor, but since the parlor wasn't what you expected in
      the first place, this is truly the werewolf den you _should_ have expected. It is dark, smells like wet
      dog, and every inch of the walls and floor are covered in &+yhair&*. You can't imagine how he must shed
      in the summer!
