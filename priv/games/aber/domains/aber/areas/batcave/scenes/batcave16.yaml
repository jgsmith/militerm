      This room is perfectly cylindrical; so perfectly smooth and proportional that it must have been carved
      out of the earth magically. The featureless wall that forms the circumference of the room is broken only
      by the entrances to the west and the north. The ceiling is as flat as the floor, (and the two are
      exactly parallel, a feat you know to be otherwise impossible in nature), and perhaps five feet above
      your head.
