    sight: >
      This is a long, widened passageway that slants downward to the north. It was obviously carved and
      smoothed by hand. It resembles a hallway you might find in a castle above ground, but for the fact that
      it has been tunneled out of solid limestone. Halfway down the ramp on the western wall is a narrow
      opening spattered with old, dried blood. To the north, the ramp comes to an end at a doorway wide enough
      for two men.
