      It's actually the Werewolf's wife that keeps the house (or cave as it were), so the place is remarkably
      _unlike_ what you expected. For one thing, the furniture is gorgeous and perfectly matches the
      carpeting. The &+Csofa&* against one wall is tastefully accentuated by the mood uplighting in the room.
      It also appears that the Mrs. is attempting to turn Mr. Werewolf into a vegetarian, for the table is
      spread with a huge meal decidedly lacking in meat.
