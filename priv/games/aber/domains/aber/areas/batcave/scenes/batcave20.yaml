      This is a large room gorgeously decorated. Potted &+Cflowers&* of all hues are arranged on the floor.
      Brightly tiled mosaics comprise the walls of the chapel, depicting scenes of ancient Egypt. The soft
      flicker of &+Yvotive candles and the perfume of a thousand bouquets almost mask the sense of
      overpowering age this room exudes. If it's possible, you feel this chamber is even more ancient than the
      antechamber.
