      You have come out from between the roots of the tree. You remember that when you last passed this tree
      the hole was the size of your hand. You panic as you realize that you must have shrunk while on your
      journey. As you look around, the trees look much bigger than they did before. Just when you decided that
      you are stuck at this small size forever, you feel yourself growing once again back to your normal size.
      You shake your head in disbelief and decide to go back to the safety of the mighty Gate of Sorcerers.
