    sight: >
      You have entered a small hut. The structure is falling down and is badly in need of maintenance. There
      are holes in the wood that make up that walls, which allow for some light to get through. On the floor
      you notice a small green object that seems to be wilting away. You wonder what it is and how it got
      there.
