      The walls are, as you can now see, lit by the reflection of the sun on small diamond chips in the walls.
      If you try hard enough, you may be able to pry a chip or two loose. As you do this, you cause a minor
      quake that seas the exit behind you. It looks like the only way out of here is to the east.
