    short: Oak Clearing
    sight: >
      You have reached the cluster of oaks, but as you stand at the edge of it, you notice that it is not a
      cluster, but a ring of trees! In the center of the ring is the largest oak tree you have ever seen. You
      stare up at it with a feeling of utter awe. You suddenly feel very small and insignificant.
