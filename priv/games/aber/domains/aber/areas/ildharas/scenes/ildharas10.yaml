    short: Along the Ruined Wall
    sight: >
      You walk along the outside of a crumbling wall. The stone, once pure white, is speckled now with moss
      and lichen. Time has worn any straight edges into soft, organic lines, while little insects have found
      their way into the cracks. The trees crowd closely against the wall in places, waging a war of their
      own.
