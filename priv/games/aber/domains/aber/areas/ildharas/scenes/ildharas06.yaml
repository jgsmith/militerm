    sight: >
      A small valley nestles between the last foothill and the beginning of the first mountain. The path has
      become very overgrown here, dwindling down to a footpath and less. Your nostrils tingle from the
      astringency of pine. Every once in a while, when there is a break in the foliage, you catch a glimpse of
      a castle against the northern mountainside.
