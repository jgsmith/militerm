      You feel the power centered in this heptagonal room. A scale model of the castle sits in the center and
      mystical symbols cover the entire floor. You realize at once that this is the heart of the castle's
      magical defense system. Some of the symbols have been marred, and the outer wall of the model has been
      broken in several places. 	The Ildharas slain during the attack are stacked along the walls like
      firewood, perfectly preserved by the strange timeless properties of the castle.
