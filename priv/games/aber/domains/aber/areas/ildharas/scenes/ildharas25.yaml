    short: Before the Sundered Throne
    sight: >
      The throne has been cloven in twain by a monstrous blow, and its precious stones have all been pried
      from their settings. Rubble and debris litter everything, but it still looks majestic in all its ruined
      splendor. Doorways lead north, east, and west, and the main hall continues south.
