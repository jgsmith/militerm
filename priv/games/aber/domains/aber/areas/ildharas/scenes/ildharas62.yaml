    sight: >
      A sense of peace pervades you in this dark, silent place. A great seven-rayed star is inscribed on the
      floor in the center, glowing with a silvery lambency. Aligned with each of the points are seven pillars
      of jet supporting a roof somewhere above. Seven eternal candles gleam on the pillars, small pinpoints of
      light in infinity. A set of doors leads south.
