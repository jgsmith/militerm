    sight: >
      This small, cheery room is filled with plush chairs and footstools. From a window in the southern wall,
      you can see the overgrown forest in the valley. A thick and priceless carpet of tan and cream nestles
      comfortably against your feet, beautiful except for the enormous blood stain in the center.
