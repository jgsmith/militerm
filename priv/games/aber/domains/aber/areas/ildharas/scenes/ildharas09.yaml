    sight: >
      Crafted from a strange white stone, the wall must have been quite impressive before the attack--though
      now you can see the castle through its mossy gaps. The trees have grown up against the walls over the
      years, and the ground beneath your boots is filled with twisting roots. Eventually, you guess, the trees
      may undermine the stones.
