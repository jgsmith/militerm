      Sparsely furnished, they do not look as grand as you might have imagined. A bed, nightstand, desk and
      chair are all pushed together in a dreary, unimaginative way. Several tarot cards lie on the desk,
      spread out in an unfamiliar pattern. A doorway leads south and you see a small alcove containing a
      library to the west.
