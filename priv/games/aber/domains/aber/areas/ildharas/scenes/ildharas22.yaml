    sight: >
      The methodic destruction has been carried on into the castle's main hall. Scorch marks mar the southern
      end, searing the great murals that once decorated the ceiling high above. Tapestries that once encircled
      the walls must have fueled the blaze. A few charcoal strands disintegrate beneath your boots. A balcony
      on the second level allowed courtiers to gaze down on the proceedings below. Doorways lead off to the
      south, east and west, while to the north sits a sundered throne.
