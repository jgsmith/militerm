    sight: >
      Once a place where treasures and heirlooms were stored, it now holds only rubble and the sad memory of
      forgotten significance. You see a blackened area in the center of the room where everything flammable
      was burned. Other things, like weapons, statues and pottery lie scattered in pieces or in pulverized
      dust. A marble staircase at far end of the room leads to the floors above and below.
