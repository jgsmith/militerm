      The wood on the inside of this door has been scratched to a smooth finish long ago. The ensuing years
      have embalmed it in a fine layer of moisture. Rusted iron chains look as if they could be easily
      snapped. This cell probably fell into disuse long before the Ildharas were attacked.
