      Strangely untouched by vandals, this beautiful room with pale carpeting and dark-stained paneling has
      seen other intruders. Someone has taken whatever valuables there were and dumped the contents of the
      shelves and drawers into a central pile, hoping to find more. A doorway leads south.
