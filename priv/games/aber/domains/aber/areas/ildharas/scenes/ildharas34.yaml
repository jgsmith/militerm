      You wander along an east-west hallway in the southern part of the castle, surrounded by cold, white
      stone. You wonder what kind of person Lusitan was, to have built such a stark place, and what kind of
      people the Ildharas were to have lived in it later. Looking out over the balcony, you can see where a
      defiled Lusitan presides over the wreckage below.
