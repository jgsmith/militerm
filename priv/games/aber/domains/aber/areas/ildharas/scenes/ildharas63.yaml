      Great power exists here. You can sense it without trying. It thrills up and down your spine and numbs
      your feet as the quiet argence paints your boots silver. This symbol, you realize, focuses power into
      something not quite recognizable. From here, you can sense the various rooms and even the surrounding
      land.
