    sight: >
      You stand in a large field littered with grave markers. Periwinkles and dandelions occasionally dot the
      grass, and a stand of weeping willows rustles with a slight breeze. A barrow mound rises to the west,
      its shadow somewhat ominous against the horizon. The field continues north where it eventually ends next
      to a forest-covered hillside.
