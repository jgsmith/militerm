      Forging your way through the thick shrubs, you stumble upon a hidden pond. Clear and pure, this water
      allows you to see to the deepest bottom. Multi- colored fishes swim here, cattails rustle slightly in
      the breeze. Water fowl float around on it's surface. As you look about, you hear myriads of little
      voices calling and taunting you. Something seems to be flitting around the northern end of the pond.
