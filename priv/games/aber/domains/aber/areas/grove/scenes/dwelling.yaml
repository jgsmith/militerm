      You have entered the dwelling of Mother Nature. Of course she lives in these beautiful lands after
      creating them. Plants and animals abound within this place, and you feel comfortable and warm. The whirr
      of insects relaxes you and you wonder what sort of person the Green Mother really is. Couches and chairs
      are made out of the natural things, grown out of either wood, moss, or some such living material. A
      miniature sun warms the place, keeping it light. The walls allow fresh air through to circulate, and
      little trickles of water flow from the ceiling keeping everything alive. The floor is springy with
      plantlife, and you slightly bounce along as you walk. Two rooms are formed off of this one.
