    short: Dark Hole Behind the Gate
    sight: >
      You've entered a somewhat dark, dank hole behind the dingy gate. The gate creaks a bit, making squeals
      that set your hair on end. For some reason, you don't know why, this place is off limits to normal
      people. There must be something very special here.
