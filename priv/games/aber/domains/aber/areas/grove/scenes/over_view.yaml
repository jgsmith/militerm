    sight: >
      You reach a high point in the forest, overlooking the entire forest. The mist slightly curls upwards to
      the sun, dew sparkling on the ground and leaves. To the north you see a well-worn path. East is a thick
      crop of shrubs. South you see the meadow of the beginning of the Elven Forest, while westwards lies a
      dense garden. The beauty might make your eyes tear a bit.
