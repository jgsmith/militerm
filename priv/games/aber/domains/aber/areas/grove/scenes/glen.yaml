    sight: >
      A small glen opens up before you, several marble benches circle a large fountain in the center of the
      area. The fountain bubbles water and glistens brightly in the warming sun. Carved into the fountain is a
      sculpture of an elven woman playing the lute, perhaps a memorial to some great lady. You see a hidden
      cottage through some bushes, amongst some trees.
