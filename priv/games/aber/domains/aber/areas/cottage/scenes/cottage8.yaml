    sight: >
      This is a clean, well kept barn. A large, cherry-red, horse-buggy sits here; it seems to be leering at
      you. On its plate you can make out a set of runes spelling "Christine". There are a few dozen different
      tools hanging here, but their purposes are beyond your experience.
