      You have entered the living room of the quaint cottage, the housewife is here busily sweeping. A family
      sized crystal ball sits here opposite a comfy, blue sofa with enormous cushions. The smell of baking
      wafts from a tiny kitchen to the east, and you may also return south to the porch.
