    short: Resevoir Bottom
    sight: >
      As you stand on the muddy bottom of the resevoir you are able to see where an underground stream fed the
      resevoir from the west. Picking your way eastward across a large jumble of stones you could probably
      make your way out of this muddy area, or you could return to the heights of the dam by ascending the
      narrow stair. There are some ancient runes here that catch your eye.
