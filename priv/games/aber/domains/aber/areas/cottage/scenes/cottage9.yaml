    sight: >
      You stand on a narrow ledge, your back to the cliff face. Above you can see the top of the cliff, but
      there is no way to climb up. Silver mists obsucre the bottom of the chasm far below. It is here that the
      wide ledge to the south meets up with a very narrow ledge to the east.
