    short: Serene Valley
    sight: >
      This valley, nestled amidst the surrounding peaks, is a place of serene tranquility. Long swaths of
      green mountain grass beckon you to kick off your boots and frolic about. A branch of the valley extends
      to the north, and you can return to the more mountainous regions lying to the east. Going west will take
      you back to the crossroads.
