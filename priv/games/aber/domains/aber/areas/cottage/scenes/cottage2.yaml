    short: Peaceful Valley
    sight: >
      You have entered a small valley snuggled amidst the towering peaks. It is so peaceful you can not help
      but smile just from being here. Animals of all kinds play about you, some even cautiously approach,
      their eyes aglow with curiosity. To the north stands a cozy cottage surrounded by a white picket fence,
      and adorned with several neatly trimmed hedges. The main branch of the valley lies to the south, and you
      may be able to slide down into a ledge to the east.
