    sight: >
      Rising all about you, you see jeweled panel and statues adorned with heiroglyphics and carvings of all
      kinds. Dominating this room however, is the immense sarcophagus of The Pharoh Ramses IV. It emanates
      tendrils of magical energy which seem to reach into your soul intently searching for you know not what.
      After a moment you realize that this room is incredibly dry, especially in comparison to the one that
      you just left.
