    sight: >
      Standing atop the underground dam you can peer over the rusted guardrail to the south, but the dam's
      bottom is hidden in blackness. The resevoir lies to the north; from here you can see a narrow staircase
      down, which continues below the waterline. A large rusted release wheel protrudes from a mass of pipes
      nearby.
