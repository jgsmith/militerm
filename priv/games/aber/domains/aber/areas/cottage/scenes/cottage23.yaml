      Water runs in rivulets down the walls of this cave, feeding the stream which meanders eastward toward
      the damn. the western wall of this forgotten cave has been cut smooth and adorned with magnificent
      carvings. In the midst of these carvings stands an ornately wrought golden door, covered in runes. You
      seem to feel strange emanations of magic brush your consciousness from somewhere behind the golden
      portal.
