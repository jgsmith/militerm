    short: Southern End of the Shoal
    sight: >
      You are more than a hundred feet from shore as you reach this end of the sand shoal. Luckily, the water
      is still no more than ankle deep, but in all directions but north, the water is too deep to safely
      traverse without aid, and even then, the waters to the west look impossibly traversable. You feel
      something slimy and smooth brush your leg, and it makes you start thinking that staying longer might not
      be the best of survival instincts.
