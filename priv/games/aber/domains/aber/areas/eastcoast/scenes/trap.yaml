    short: In the Pit Trap
    sight: >
      You find yourself brushing the dirt off your clothes as you take stock of the situation. This pit
      appears to have been carefully dug out, and carefully laid over with sticks and covered in stones, save
      for the hole that you fell through. You try to leap for a handhold at the top, but hopelessly cannot
      find anything in reach, showing you that this pit was built to hold much larger creatures. Small rodents
      and other land-dwelling animals are here, but all starved to death. Obviously the last time that the
      trapper checked this trap was quite some time. You just hope that he remembers it today...
