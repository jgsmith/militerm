    sight: >
      The path here rises up and you find yourself looking down into the murky swamp, wishing that you didn't.
      A vast expanse of dark and demented plant growth, you feel some dreadfully evil influence has been the
      cause of this. In the face of the cliff here is recessed a cave, where within, you can only discern
      blackness, though you spy some boot prints leading in and out of the cave, evidence that someone resides
      here. A smell emanates from the cave, reminding you of some old stale bread and musty animal skins. To
      the east and west, the path continues to thread its way along the base of the cliff. Looking again into
      the swamp, as if your eyes are drawn there, you spy a glimmer of gold in the dark murk, but before you
      can blink to clear your vision, the bright spot is gone. The path leads off at a descending slope to the
      east and west, and a smaller trail leads south, toward a small grassy glade.
