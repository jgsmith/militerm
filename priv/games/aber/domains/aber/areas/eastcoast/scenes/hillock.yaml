    sight: >
      Sights and scents of the meadowlands assault you as you stand on top of a low-rolling hill covered in
      grasses and field plants. Looking around, you see the rolling hills flatten out as it descends to the
      east, where a blue-white haze of the horizon hints at a coastline. The trail you stand on appears more
      beaten to the east, a small climb up a rocky slope to the west looks possible, and an inviting meadow is
      to your south. You nearly overlook an almost abandoned trail to the north.
