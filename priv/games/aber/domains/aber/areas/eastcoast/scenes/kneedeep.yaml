    sight: >
      Foamy water laps hungrily at your calves and knees as you stand here in shallow water some thirty feet
      east from the shoreline. Not much can be seen from here except a line of rocks extending out into the
      sea to the north and a small boating dock to the south. It seems that the water waves are breaking too
      far from the shore than normal, hinting at a sand shoal to the east, but you are not sure if you could
      reach it. More accessible routes appear to lie back toward the shore and farther south along the
      shallows.
