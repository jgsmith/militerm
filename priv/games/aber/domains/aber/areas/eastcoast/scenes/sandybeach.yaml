    sight: >
      You walk onto the white sands of a beach, the waters of the sea creating frothy waves that crash into
      the surf. The beach continues to the north, where you see a rock outcropping that goes a short distance
      into the sea. To the east you notice that a little dip in the water is not impossible since the water
      appears somewhat shallow. A small gap in the rocks to the south is just large enough for you to fit
      through.
