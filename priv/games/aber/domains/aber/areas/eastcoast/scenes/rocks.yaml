    sight: >
      You carefully pick your way among large boulders lined in an east- west line, going out about forty feet
      from the shore, obviously built by past inhabitants to break the dangerous waves that come into the
      beach. From here, you can see paths following the beach to the north and south, and you can go inland by
      walking west toward a patch of thorny brambles, or by following a steep path up a sandy dune. If you are
      careful, you can make your way east out to the end of the rocks.
