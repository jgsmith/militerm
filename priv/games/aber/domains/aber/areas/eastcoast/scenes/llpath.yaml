    sight: >
      You follow a winding path in the low bends around rolling hills, and quickly lose track of progress. The
      plants here, living on more rocky soil, are not as varied and rich as the ones that you see to the
      south. The hills are tall here, giving you little view of the land around you. The only promising routes
      lie between two hills to the north, where the path starts to cut into a large and rocky third hill, and
      to the south up an even larger hill.
