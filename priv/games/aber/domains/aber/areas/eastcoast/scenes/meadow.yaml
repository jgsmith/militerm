    sight: >
      Grassy hills roll off into the distance here as you walk by, and you smell the fragrances of the wild
      grasses and flowers growing all around. The hills flatten out to a large field to the west, where you
      hear the bleating of sheep. Another path to the south makes a easterly turn along a cliff edge.
