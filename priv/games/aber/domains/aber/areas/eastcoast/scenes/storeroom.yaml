    sight: >
      This small room seems to you a recent addition of the Trapper's, with rough edges still in the rock
      walls, and even bits of freshly chipped stone still littering the floor. This room was apparently made
      to store all the Trapper's rapidly growing piles of semi-useless equipment and other necessities. The
      only exit from here is through a small carved hole to the west.
