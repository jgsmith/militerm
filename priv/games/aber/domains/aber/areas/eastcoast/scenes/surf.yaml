    sight: >
      The sand here feels soft at your feet and the water splashing up from the sea feels exhilaratingly cool.
      A brisk breeze from the east blows in from the great sea, blowing at your hair. You can follow the sandy
      shore to the north and south, and to the west you see a steep bank of a long sand dune.
