    sight: >
      You are standing in front of a looming cliff, towering some eighty or ninety feet above you, but from
      the perspective, it might be higher. Seagulls fly about nearby, occasionally giving a shrill call to
      their brethren.The cliff here bends off toward the north, cradling a narrow beach, and also falls off to
      the west, where a path rises over a sandy hill and out of sight.
