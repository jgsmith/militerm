    short: Escarpment Path
    sight: >
      You are half climbing, half slipping on the stones and dirt of a steep path climbing the side of an
      escarpment. From here, you can see a expanse of swampland to the south, and to the east you can see a
      blue sea stretching out. Looking back to the dreariness of your surroundings, the path appears to
      continue above you, heading near some old castle walls, and down into the murky swamplands below.
