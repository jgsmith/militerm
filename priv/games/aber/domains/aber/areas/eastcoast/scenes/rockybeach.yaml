    sight: >
      Small rocks and pebbles intermingle with the sands of the beach here, making you check your steps, lest
      you slip. The cliff appears to drop off to the south from here, and you can investigate further by
      following the beach to the south, or to follow the increasingly narrowing coast to the north.
