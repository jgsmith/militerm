      This is apparently the Trapper's sleeping quarters, simply an indented crevice in the main cave room
      itself. Somewhat inclined from the floor, you see many animal furs scattered about the small space, and
      on a small ledge, you see various personal articles of the Trapper, most of which look useless or not to
      your liking at all. The only obvious exit from here is south back into the main cave.
