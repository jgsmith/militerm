    sight: >
      You stand amid a sea of yellow-flowered buttercups, giving this place an aura of golden beauty, making
      you squint from the brightness. Colorful butterflies and birds flit by, giving this place a sense of
      vibrant life and beauty. The golden sea appears to end to the east, where a sharp cliff drops off to the
      dull sound of crashing water, and to the west leads a beaten trail into an area of grassy hills. To the
      south, you see the hills flatten out to a large field, with what looks like sheep in the distance.
