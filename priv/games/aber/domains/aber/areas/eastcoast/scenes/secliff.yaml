    short: Southern Edge of Cliff
    sight: >
      South of the rolling hills, you overlook from a cliff edge the lowlands of the swamps looming some two
      hundred feet below you to the south. Lucky for you, a sturdy looking fence is between you and the ground
      far below the cliff. Even with the fence, doing anything gymnastic would be foolhardy. You can follow
      the cliff edge to the east, or follow a westward path wending its way to some hills.
