    sight: >
      Scrabbling for a foothold, you stop for a moment, and look through the misty air to see treacherous
      rocks far enough below you to make a jump a futile effort of survival. The only sound you hear is the
      dull and thunderous sounds of the waves crashing into the rocks below. A thick mist envelops the air
      around you, obscuring the surroundings and making the rocks here slippery to the touch, but you can
      discern footholds safe enough to climb up the face of the cliff, and a slightly (but not by much) safer
      path, only a crack in the rock, leading down near the rocks below.
