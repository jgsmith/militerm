    sight: >
      The loamy smell and plaintive sound of bleating sheep is the first thing you notice as you walk down
      into this large flat field. Hills frame the north and the west, the ground appears to drop off beyond a
      fence to the south, and to the east, a modest but welcoming cottage making this place look like the
      idyllic scene of pastoral harmony.
