    sight: >
      This is a small meadow that appears to not have been affected by the stunting effects of the swamp.
      Though you feel comforted in seeing such a peaceful looking place, you also feel the eerie feeling of
      the swamp just beyond a shock of tall, impenetrable looking brambles. To the north leads a small path
      that appears to head up sharply toward a small black hole in face of the cliffs. A grassy path turns
      into a sandy trail as it descends toward a small lagoon to the east, and to the south, you see a stream
      across the soft grass.
