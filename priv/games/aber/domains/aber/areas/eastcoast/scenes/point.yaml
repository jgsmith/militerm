      This is the famous point of that man, the Dreamer, who made this high corner of the cliff the popular
      place that it is. From here, you can see for miles around. To the east and running along toward the
      south as far as the eye can see, the great sea stretches out to the horizon, its blue waters drawing
      your eyes hypnotically. You see islands out in the distant water, but can only imagine what they are
      like. To the south you see a flat lowlands, dominated by a dark mass of trees, the Swamps of Peril.
      Outlining the swamp is a long beach, running up to the cliff foot directly under you, and then splitting
      off, one trail continuing north up the beach, and the other disappearing out of view to the west. A
      range of mountains line the valley far to the west and southwest, and nestled in front of the range
      directly to the west is an old and eroding castle, with one black tower still defiantly standing. A path
      leading north is the only way out of this narrow cliff corner.
