    sight: >
      You walk into a somewhat dank and musty smelling cave. Looking at the furs and the animal heads lined up
      on the walls, you must surmise that this is the humble residence of the Trapper, with all the piles of
      useless traps lying nearby in a corner. From here, you spy a darker niche in the northern end of the
      cave, while to the east is a dark hole that your light source cannot penetrate.
