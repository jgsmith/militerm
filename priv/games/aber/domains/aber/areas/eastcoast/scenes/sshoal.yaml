    short: On a Sandy Shoal
    sight: >
      You step up onto a shallow sand shoal, some eighty to ninety feet east of the shoreline. Looking at the
      ankle-deep water here, you discover that the waves are broken somewhat by the shoal, since you are only
      swaying in your steps at each wave instead of floundering head over heels. The water is noticeably
      colder here, giving hint that any travelling farther east would not only be dangerous due to the waves
      and sea creatures, but also to the exposure of the cold water. You can follow the shoal to the north and
      south, or back to toward the west, since the water looks much shallower here.
