    short: Gentle Beach
    sight: >
      Soft sand underfoot, the moth-like licking of the waves upon the surf, and the cool sea breeze are the
      meanest things that assault you as you tread this lonely beach. The water at this end of the coast is
      ringed in by a perimeter of sharp rocks, supposedly brought in some time in the past to break the
      tortuous waves beyond, and it in effect creates a calm lagoon. You see a tall cliff loom up from the
      north, the beach leading up to a sharp west-north bend. A bleak-looking stream lets out a little ways to
      the south, just north of a line of more tide-breaking stones. The cool, refreshing waters seem to beckon
      to you, to join in the knee- deep waters to the east.
