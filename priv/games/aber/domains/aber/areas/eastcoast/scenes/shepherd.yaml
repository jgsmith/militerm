      This is the sparse and simple home of the shepherd, a little too simplistic for an adventurer of your
      tastes, but obviously adequate to the shepherd. A table with two chairs rests against the eastern wall,
      a window over the table showing more rolling hills outside. A simple straw bed lies to the south, a
      stone hearth to the north, and an exit back outside lies to the west.
