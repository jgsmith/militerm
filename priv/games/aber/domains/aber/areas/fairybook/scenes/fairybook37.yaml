      The floor of this room is decorated with a large black-and-white checkerboard pattern. The walls are
      curved slightly, creating the illusion of being inside a giant checkered hat. In the center of the room
      is a hat the size of a rowboat, with an open top. Curious, you peer over the top to find that the inside
      is padded. In random places around the room, someone has left hats lying around. Below you is a large
      room.
