      Three large thrones rest upon three stone diases. Each is a different color: The one on the right is
      red, the one on the left is white, and the one in the center is golden. The hall is otherwise decorated
      with the letter 'A' in various places: on banners, flags, paintings - even carved into the floor. The
      exit is to the south.
