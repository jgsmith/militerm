    sight: >
      Walking over fields of soft green grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups, you see a
      sign that points to the west. The sign tells you that that is the direction towards the castle of the
      Wicked Witch of the West, and you recall hearing a rumor that she has reportedly enslaved all
      trespassers. The path also goes east to the yellow brick road.
