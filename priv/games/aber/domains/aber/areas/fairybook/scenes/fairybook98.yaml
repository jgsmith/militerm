    sight: >
      The Never-Bird lives in a nest which once grew above the lagoon. When the pirates cut down the tree,
      they threw the nest into the lagoon, where the Never-Bird found it again. As it is a Never-Bird nest, it
      floats, and has been used as a regular nest for years. To the west is Marooners Rock.
