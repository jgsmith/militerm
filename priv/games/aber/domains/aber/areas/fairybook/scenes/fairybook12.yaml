    sight: >
      You stand in a puddle up to your waist, which turns out to be deeper than it looks. Fortunately, it is
      an ocean of tears, filled with salt water which buoys you up. You see other creatures splashing their
      way toward the shore to the east. To the west is dry land, and a large table.
