      The home underground is one large room, with a floor in which you can dig if you want to go fishing, and
      from which sprout great mushrooms of a charming colour. These mushrooms can be used as stools, and grow
      in a circle around a Nevertree, which tries hard to grow in the centre of the room. There is an enormous
      fireplace which is in almost any part of the room where you care to light it. Across this is strung
      strings of fibre, from which one can hang the wash. The bed is standing against the wall. The basket in
      which the youngest Lost Boy sleeps is to the west, and Tinkerbell's apartment is to the east.
