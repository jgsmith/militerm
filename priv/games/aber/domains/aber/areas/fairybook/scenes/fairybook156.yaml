    sight: >
      You stand before the gates of the Yellow Castle. Here it is rumored that the wicked witch of the west
      lives. Of course, you know how reliable rumors are. The castle is painted a shade of yellow which you
      can neither name nor recognize. The walls are high, and the windows pointed. The path goes east and
      west.
