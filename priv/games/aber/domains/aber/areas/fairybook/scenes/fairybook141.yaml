    sight: >
      Even with your eyes protected by green spectacles, you would dazzled by the brilliancy of the Emerald
      City. The streets are lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with
      sparkling emeralds. You walk over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks are joined
      together are rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window
      panes are of green glass; even the sun above the city has a green tint, and the rays of the sun appear
      green. The path goes north and south.
