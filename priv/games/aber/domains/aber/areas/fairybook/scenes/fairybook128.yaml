    short: The Great Ditch
    sight: >
      You stand at a great ditch that crosses the road and divides the forest as far as you can see on either
      side. It is a very wide ditch, and when you look over the edge you can see many big, jagged rocks at the
      bottom. The sides are too steep to climb down, but you might be able to jump across. . . The path
      continues to the north.
