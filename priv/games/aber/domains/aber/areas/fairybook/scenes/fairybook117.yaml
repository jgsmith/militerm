    sight: >
      You stand in a huge cornfield. Overlooking the field is a scarecrow. Its head is a small sack stuffed
      with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that
      once belonged to a Munchkin, is perched upon this head, and the rest of the figure is a blue suit of
      clothes, worn and faded, which has also been stuffed with straw. On the feet are some old boots with
      blue tops, and the figure is raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back. As
      you look, it winks at you. The only exit is to the north.
