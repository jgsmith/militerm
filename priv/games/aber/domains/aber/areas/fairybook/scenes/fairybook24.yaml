    sight: >
      You stand atop a mushroom, over-looking the rest of the mushroom field. The mushroom you stand on is
      purple and red, and you cannot recall having ever seen one like this before. From here, you can see the
      field of flowers to the west, the paths to the north and south, and a house to the east.
