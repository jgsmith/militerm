      Hook's cabin occupies most of the lower level of the ship. It contains a tiny swimming pool, a bunk, a
      table full of food, and a pile of treasure the likes of which you have never seen. Golden fittings line
      the walls and the furniture, and even the pool sparkles in the light. The opulence and wealth in this
      room are astounding in their brilliance and cannot be described. The deck is to the west.
