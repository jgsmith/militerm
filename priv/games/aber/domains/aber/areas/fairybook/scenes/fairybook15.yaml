    sight: >
      You stand on a garden path, which stretches out to the east and west. For some reason, you are certain
      that you shall be late for something. You notice that the trees here are made of toothpicks and tissue
      paper, and seem quite old. To the west us a small door, through which you can make out an ocean far in
      the distance. Far ahead to the south, you see a white blur on the same path as you.
