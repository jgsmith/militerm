    sight: >
      The rabbit hole goes straight, like a tunnel, for a few feet, and then sharply descends as you find
      yourself falling into a deep well. The descent goes slowly, and you are able to brake your fall at a few
      places. However, you cannot continue up again. I wonder how you shall get out again.
