    sight: >
      You stand on the Never-Path. From here at the crossroads you can choose any direction to follow, any
      adventure to try, any story to live. To the east lies Slightly Gulch, where the Redskins battle the Lost
      Boys. To the west is the Clearing, where the Lost Boys live. To the north is Kidd's Creek, where the
      Jolly Roger is berthed. To the south is the Mermaid's Lagoon, where Peter Pan once nearly died to save
      Tiger Lily. Choose your path . . .
