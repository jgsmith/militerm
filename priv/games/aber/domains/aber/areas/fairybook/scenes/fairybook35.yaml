      There is a table set under a tree in front of a house. Three rather odd characters sit around it. The
      table is rather large, but the three are crowded at one corner. An armchair is empty at the head of the
      table. On top of the table is a full spread for tea. A path leads to the west, a second leads north, and
      a house stands to the east.
