    sight: >
      You stand in the village of the Winkies, the Munchkins of the west. They are cowardly people who do only
      what they are told. They roam the area dressed in leather armor and carry spears, so that no-one wants
      to speak to them and maybe tell them to do something. The path goes east and west from here.
