      Dorothy's house in Kansas is small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon for several
      miles. There are four walls, a floor, and a roof, which make one room; and this room contains a rusty
      looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and two beds. A
      trap-door leads down to the cyclone cellar, a door to the east leads to the garden, and a shimmering
      door to the north goes back to the library.
