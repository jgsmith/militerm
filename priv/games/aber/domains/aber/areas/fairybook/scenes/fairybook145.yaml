    short: The Throne Room
    sight: >
      You stand in a big, round room with a high, arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor are covered
      with large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof is a great light, as bright as the
      sun, which make the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner. A big throne of green marble stands in the
      middle of the room. It is shaped like a chair and sparkles with gems, as does everything else. In the
      center of the chair is an enormous head, without body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. The
      path leads south, and a curtain hangs in the west corner.
