    sight: >
      You stand on the cobbled stones of the yellow courtyard. The walls seem to glow with an un-earthly
      light, washing out your features and making your skin turn orange. From here you can go up to Dorothy's
      room, out to the exercise yard to the south, or to the kitchen to the north. The exit from the building
      is to the east.
