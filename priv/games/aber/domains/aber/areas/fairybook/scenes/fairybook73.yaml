      You carefully follow the path, when suddenly a loud noise causes you to jump into the bushes. Two
      Knights thunder pass you from opposite directions, intersecting in front of you. With a loud crash they
      meet, and both are unseated. They both see you at the same moment, and prepare to attack. They stand in
      place, waiting for your first move. The path continues east and west.
