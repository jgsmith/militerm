    sight: >
      You stand in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There are patches of green sward all about,
      with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers are on every hand, and
      birds with rare and brilliant plumage sing and flutter in the trees and bushes. A little way off is a
      small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring pleasantly.
