    short: Forest Path
    sight: >
      The rough path turns into a forested path, as bits of moss grow between the golden stones of the path.
      The woods here as think, covering the bricks with dried branches and dead leaves from the trees. Birds
      fly high overhead, occasionally swooping down to pick an insect out of the air. The exits are north and
      south.
