    sight: >
      The first thing you notice inside this small building is the overall mess. Perhaps it has been burgled:
      the sofa cushions are missing, and ink has been poured over all of the plants. A tiny door leads to the
      north, and the exit is west. A sign next to the door reads 'Beware of the". The end of the sign appears
      to have been chewed off.
