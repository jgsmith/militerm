    sight: >
      You stand at an intersection of three paths. To the west you see a small house in the distance, to the
      north is a tiny grey hut, and to the south it leads to a clearing. A signpost here tells you that the
      west is 'The Duchess', the north is 'March Hare', and the south is 'Mad Hatter.'
