      The King and Queen of Hearts are seated on their throne. A great crowd is assembled about them - all
      sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards; the Knave stands before them, in
      chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; near the King stands the White Rabbit, with a trumpet
      in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other. The King serves as judge,. wearing his crown atop a
      white powdered wig. Twelve creatures sit in the jury box, the jurors. You realize that most of these
      creatures are merely ghosts of those you have killed. A great desk looms above you, behind which sits
      the Judge.
