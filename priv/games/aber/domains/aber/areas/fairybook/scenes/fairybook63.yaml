      You step across another brook and your surroundings change again. You find yourself standing in a shop,
      full of all manner of curious things - but the oddest part of it is that whenever you look hard at any
      shelf, to make out exactly what it has on it, that particular shelf is always quite empty, though the
      others round it are crowded as full as they can hold. The shop becomes deeper to the east.
