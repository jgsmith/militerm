    sight: >
      You stand in front of a good-sized farmhouse by the side of the road. The green glow is brighter now,
      outshining the luster of the road. A path meanders to the west from here, leading off into a patch of
      darkness. A sign here reads Glinda and points into the farmhouse. To the south the path goes into the
      woods.
