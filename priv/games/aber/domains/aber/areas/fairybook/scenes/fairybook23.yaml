    short: Mushroom Field
    sight: >
      The forest has unexpectedly become a field of mushrooms. To the east you can see trees, as to the south.
      To the west is a field of red flowers, from which a sweet smell emits. To the north is a path through
      the forest. Rising in front of you here is a tall mushroom, the tallest you have ever seen. With a bit
      of effort, you might be able to pull yourself up onto it.
