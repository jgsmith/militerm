    short: Beautiful Garden
    sight: >
      You find yourself in a beautiful garden, among bright flower beds and cool fountains. A large rose tree
      stands at the entrance, with three gardeners standing in front of it painting the white roses red. In
      the distance to the south, you see a croquet field. There is a door in the center of the tree, through
      which you see a crystal room.
