    short: Croquet Field
    sight: >
      You suspect that you have never seen such a curious croquet ground in your life. It is all ridges and
      furrows, bumpy and uneven ground. The croquet balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes.
      The arches are made of giant playing card soldiers, doubled over on their hands and feet. To the north
      is a path leading to the garden, and to the east you see a low building.
