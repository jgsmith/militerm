    sight: >
      You stand in a large train, full of an odd assortment of travellers. The seats are made of naugha-hide,
      and the ceiling is made of glass. As you wait, you feel an odd twist in your stomach. The scenery
      outside changes suddenly, and you are at your destination. The exit is to the east.
