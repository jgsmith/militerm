    sight: >
      The yellow brick road continues, as the forest begins to thin out. To the south a fallen tree crosses a
      ditch, and to the north is a broad, flowing swiftly river. On the other side of the water you can see
      the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright
      flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits.
