      Slightly Gulch, the site of a famous battle between the Lost Boys and the Redskins, has been a piece of
      history for years. The Redskins and Lost Boys decided one day to trade sides completely, and left at the
      end of the day declaring a stalemate. It is populated by sparse shrubs and bushes and the occasional
      scraggly tree. Exits lie to the east and the west.
