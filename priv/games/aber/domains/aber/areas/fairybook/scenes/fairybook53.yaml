    sight: >
      You stand at the top of the hill and stand without speaking for a few minutes, looking out in all
      directions over the country - and a most curious country it is. A number of tiny little brooks run
      straight across it from side to side, and the ground between is divided into squares by a number of
      little green hedges, that reach from brook to brook. You realize that it is laid out just like a chess
      board, and search for the playing pieces. Sure enough, you see them. You also see a path leading from
      your current location, down the hill, and across the field to the east.
