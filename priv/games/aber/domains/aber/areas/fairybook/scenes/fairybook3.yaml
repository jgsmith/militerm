    short: A Sleepy Bank
    sight: >
      You stand on the bank of a gently flowing river. Daisies grow all around you, soaking up the warm summer
      sun. Their smell is quite intoxicating, and makes you feel quite relaxed. A large oak tree rises from
      the bank, spreading its branches wide to provide shade for anyone who wishes to curl up at its base and
      rest for awhile. Just as you decide to take a nap in these Elysian surroundings, a white rabbit with
      pink eyes runs past you muttering to itself and vanishes to the east. In the direction that it
      disappeared you see a large hole in the ground. To the west is the door to the library, and the paths to
      the north and south don't seem to go anywhere.
