      The private apartment of Tinkerbell can be shut off from the rest of the home by pulling a curtain
      across the doorway. The couch is a genuine Queen Mab with club legs. The mirror is a Puss-in-boots, of
      which there are now only three. The wash-stand is Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an
      authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs of the best (the early) period of Margery and
      Robin. There is a chandelier from Tiddlywinks. You can exit west.
