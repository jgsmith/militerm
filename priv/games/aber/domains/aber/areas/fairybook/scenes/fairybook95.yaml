    sight: >
      The Mermaid's Lagoon is an infamous place. The surf crashes up on the beach of pure, white sand. It is a
      wonderful place for swimming, diving, or building sand castles. The water is so clear that you can see
      fish as deep as 30 meters, which is pretty deep. A great distance from the shore to the east is
      Marooner's Rock.
