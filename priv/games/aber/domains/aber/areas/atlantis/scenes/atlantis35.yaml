      As you flow along with the rush of aquatic life forms bustling up and down Main Street you notice a
      small sign on the outside of a building on the on the east side of the street proclaiming 'Speedy's
      Message Service.' As you pass outside the doorway, you catch the blur of something that exits the
      doorway and returns. You can investigate the interior of the store to the east or head along Main Street
      to the north and south.
