    sight: >
      You're not certain how it managed to get here, but the passage is blocked by a large growth of sea weed.
      It completely surrounds the tunnel around you and chokes off any further passage. If you want you can
      attempt to push your way through it to the east or west, or head back up the corridor with a faint glow
      to the north.
