    sight: >
      This short waterway ends abruptly after a short distance. You see a large number of tourists heading
      through a door to the south and hear a coughing sound coming from the doorway to the north. A few sharks
      also emerge from the doorway to the south, making gestures as if something were jumping around inside.
