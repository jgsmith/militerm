    sight: >
      You have entered upon a simple altar. Against the far wall of the room is a small block altar that
      appears to be part of the wall that extends out into the room. On top of the altar is a horizontal
      groove. Above the altar, carved into the wall is an icon that looks very much like a trident. Under the
      icon is the inscription 'When this trident is returned shall the city of Atlantis be redeemed.'
