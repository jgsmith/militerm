    sight: >
      You stand before one of the Sand Towers you could see from outside the Castle. The tower is in slight
      need of repair because it is starting to sag a bit under the water's weight but it otherwise holding up
      well. Looking through the windows further up the tower you can see a hollow passage leading all the way
      up to the top of the tower in which fish and sharks are swimming up and down, patrolling the tower,
      viewing the surrounding water. You are able to swim back to the east to the courtyard or south to a
      sandy passage.
