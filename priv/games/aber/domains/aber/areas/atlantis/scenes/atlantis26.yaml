    sight: >
      A large area of the sea bed has been marked off with a stone barrier of some sort, defining the confines
      of the pasture the sea cows get to roam in. There is a section at the far end of the field where kelp
      grows for the sea cows to eat. Looking at the cows it appears that they are pretty content to be here.
