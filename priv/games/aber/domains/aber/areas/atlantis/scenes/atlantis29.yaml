    sight: >
      You stand before Main Street, looking at the sights around you. Nearby, street vendors are selling
      souveniers from Atlantis, most of whom are being ignored. Small homes line either side of the watery
      road, made of some sand-like material. You see merfolk peer out the windows of their homes at you. Fish
      and merfolk pass by you towards Main Street, where the traffic seems to split off to the north and
      south. You can follow the stream of traffic or head back west to leave the city.
