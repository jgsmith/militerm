    sight: >
      You manage to shove your way through the thick growths of the kelp, to find yourself completely
      surrounded on all sides by it. There is so much of it that it's difficult to see in any real direction.
      Thick growths of the plant form dense walls to the north and east, and seem only slightly less dense to
      the west and south.
