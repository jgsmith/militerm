    sight: >
      You have just moved into the exotic section of the Terrarium. Behind the glass-like shields you see the
      creatures that are quite familiar to you: orcs, dwarves, gnolls, insect-like creatures, a family of
      ogres, a captured demon and even a baby dragon! The aquatic tourists are especially interested in this
      place, with all the life forms they never see otherwise. You feel fortunate that you aren't one of the
      displays.
