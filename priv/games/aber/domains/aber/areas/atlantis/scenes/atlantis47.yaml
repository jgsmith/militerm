    sight: >
      This watery shop is quite sparse as the only thing contained inside of it is a coral countertop for
      messages. The rest of the room is empty save for an up-to-date aquatic calendar on the wall and a few
      sponge chairs arranged around the room which seem to have never been used, as no one is ever kept
      waiting. On the counter is a slogan of some sort: 'Speedy's Messenger Service: Messages delivered while
      you wait!'. You notice at the bottom of the fine print the clause 'This is backed by a lifetime
      guarantee--no customer waits longer than their natural life.' An opening in the building leads back out
      west onto Main Street.
