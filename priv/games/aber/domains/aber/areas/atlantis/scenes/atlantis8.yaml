    sight: >
      The crushed prow of the cargo ship lies half-buried in the sand here. Fish swim leisurely through holes
      in the prow while half-hidden creatures tenatively poke their heads out from the prow to investigate the
      disturbance your presence is making through the water. You can almost make out the graceful features of
      a mermaid that adorns the front of the prow but the features have been eaten away by the currents of the
      sea. Underneath the mermaid you notice a plaque that reads 'The Anemone'.
