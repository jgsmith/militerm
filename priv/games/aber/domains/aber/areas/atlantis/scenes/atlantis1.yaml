      What a close shave! You nearly collided with the cliff face a couple of times on the way down and just
      barely missed the rocks but you are now safely submerged in water. It makes you feel strangely bouyant,
      and you find you are able to move freely. It doesn't look like you will be able to get back up the cliff
      face behind you, but heading further down appears to still be an option.
