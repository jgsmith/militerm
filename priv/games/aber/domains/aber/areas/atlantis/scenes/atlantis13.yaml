    sight: >
      Kelp grows in abundance here, but sparsely. You can see large fish swimming inbetween the strands and
      smaller aquatic life scuttling along near the bottom of the plants. Exotic fish glide quietly in front
      of your face, in search of nourishment. You get an odd feeling of peacefulness here.
