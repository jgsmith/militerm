    sight: >
      You have never seen so many shells in your entire life. It seems this is where the denizens of Atlantis
      desposit all their shells when they are through with them. Seashells of all colors and varieties
      dominate the pile while more exotic ones can be seen scattered throughout. There is even a snail shell
      to one side of the pile that is the size of a small horse, colored a very lovely shade of pink.
      Scattered around the pile are smaller versions of that shell along with discarded oyster, clam and crab
      shells. This would be quite the treasure if you could bring them all back with you.
