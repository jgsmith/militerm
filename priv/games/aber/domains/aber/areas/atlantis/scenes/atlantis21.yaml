      Before you are the gates to the Lost City of Atlantis. The gates are about twice as high as the average
      merman and they are wide open, to allow the stream of aquatic life through the gates. All forms of life
      pour through the gates, on their daily business or just to sightsee. It appears that Atlantis has become
      quite the tourist attraction as it's fame has grown, so aquatic life forms from all over journey to
      visit. You may swim through the gates to the east, enter a kelp bed to the north or head back along the
      sea bed to the west.
