      So here it is. The Lost City of Atlantis. Upon viewing it, the city actually doesn't look all that
      impressive. It seems that the legends about it have been so blown out of proportion that the real reason
      for it's being here may have been lost, and instead lavish stories have been created to explain it. Now
      it looks like a somewhat small village with a rather large aquatic tourist population drawn here by the
      legend of the city. All forms of aquatic life bustle about through the gates on their own agendas. You
      can leave the city through the gates behind you to the west or continue towards Main Street to the east.
