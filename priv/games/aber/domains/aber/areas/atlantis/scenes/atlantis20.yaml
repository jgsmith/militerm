    sight: >
      Kelp grows in sparse growths here, becoming very thick toward the north. Something scuttles under your
      feet, startling you for a moment. You look after to see what it was but it's long since scuttled along
      on it's merry way. You can head into the thinner kelp to the west, push your way through the thicker
      growths to the north or head towards some gates to the south.
