    sight: >
      Long strands of kelp reach up from the sea floor here, sheltering small schools of fish who make their
      home here. The kelp sways in the current, performing some strange, exotic dance. The kelp grows more
      closely together to the north and east, while it thins out to the west and to the south, near a large
      gate.
