    short: Before the Sand Castle
    sight: >
      Before you stands a large Sand Castle. Short, stubby towers stand out above the rest of the Castle,
      bright flags of abalone worked into the top of each. Through the empty window of each tower you catch
      glimpses of shark sentries. The multiple levels of the castle show activity on each one and if you watch
      long enough you notice servants swimming outside the castle on shortcuts to reach the higher levels
      instead of passing through the castle. You can enter into the courtyard by swimming south or head back
      to Main Street to the north.
