    sight: >
      As you pass along this path, you are surrounded by a large group of small, brighly colored yellow fish.
      They swirl around you like a minature tornado then swiftly swim off again into the sea depths. You can
      continue to swim along the path towards the cave to the east or back towards the garden to the west.
