    sight: >
      As you swim along Main Street you see a plaque outside one building indicating that it is a hotel. You
      notice all sorts of aquatic creatures enter and leave the hotel, some of whom can barely swim through
      the door, they're so exhausted from sight-seeing. As you pass outside the Hotel, you hear the strains of
      something that sounds like piano coming from inside the hotel, but it sounds odd and somewhat muffled.
      You can enter the hotel to the east or head north and south on Main Street.
