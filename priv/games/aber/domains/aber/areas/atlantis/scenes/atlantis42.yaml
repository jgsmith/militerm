    sight: >
      You've reached an intersection just off of the Courtyard. There is an opening in the buildings, leading
      off into what looks like servant's quarters, but it is being guarded. Merfolk bustle mostly out of the
      opening, heading out towards the throne room to the south. A few others cross the courtyard to the west
      on other business.
