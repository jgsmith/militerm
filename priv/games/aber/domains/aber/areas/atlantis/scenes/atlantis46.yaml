    sight: >
      A glorious sight to behold is the Octopus' Garden. Streaks of color come from arranged anemones and
      colored plant life. Statues of coral are arranged tastefully about the garden and small pathways lead in
      winding circles through all the colorful plants. Hedges of darker coral block off your view from certain
      sections which, once beyond the hedge, provide even more spectacular views due to the partitioning.
      Lovers swim along the paths through the plants and tourists come from all over to view this beautiful
      sight.
