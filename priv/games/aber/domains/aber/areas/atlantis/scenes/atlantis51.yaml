    sight: >
      A large stone cave opening looms before you, casting its shadow upon the sea bed behind you. Through the
      opening you can see nothing but a lot of darkness and the cave gives you the appearance of being able to
      swallow you up. You can enter into the cave to the east or head back along the path to the west.
