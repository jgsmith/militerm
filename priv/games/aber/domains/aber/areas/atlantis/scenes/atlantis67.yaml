    sight: >
      The walls of this dead-end cave are also glass smooth. You realize from this lair that the walls you
      recently saw were due to the serpent rubbing against them in passage all these years. It probably
      crawled into these caves for food then grew too large for the passages until it became trapped inside.
      This dead-end passage is completely barren and smooth due to the vast amount of time the serpent spent
      sleeping here. You can swim back to the passageway to the south.
