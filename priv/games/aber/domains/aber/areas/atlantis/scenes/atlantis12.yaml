    sight: >
      A large rock formation juts out from the sea floor here, making a large impenetrable wall to the south.
      Colorful plant life sticks to the wall, making it look like the outcropping has polka-dots if you stand
      back far enough from it. Your eye catches a glimpse of something moving in the wall, then loses track of
      it. You can swim back north or follow the wall to the east.
