      You enter a cozy little home made out of the sand-like substance you've viewed elsewhere. The home is
      rather small, with some sleeping beds on the floor to one side neatly arranged. They appear to be made
      out of kelp. A small cooking arrangement is along the far wall and a door leads west outside. A heavy
      table made of stone dominates the room and you notice a note on the table held down by a rock. It says
      'Went to work luring adventurers in the High Priest's Quarters again. Have a good day at the Hotel. All
      my love. -Mara' Beyond this, the home is very clean and sparse. You can swim south back to the street or
      west to the pasture where the family keeps their cows.
