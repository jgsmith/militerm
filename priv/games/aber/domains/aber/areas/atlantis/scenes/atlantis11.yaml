    short: Sea Floor Rise
    sight: >
      The sea floor rises gently here, leading up to a barren sandy spot on top of a small hill. Off to the
      east you see the tops of some buildings sticking up above a sand-packed wall. The sea bed falls away
      gradualy from this spot on the other three sides, leading back toward the cliff face to the west,
      towards a small depression to the north and towards a rocky ridge to the south.
