      The sea bed rises slightly to the east here. Small creatures scuttle along the sea floor or glide
      gracefully through the water. Larger fish chase after smaller ones through the water, providing a merry
      spectacle as they dart to and fro. A large ridge of earth blocks any sort of passage to the south, while
      the cliff behind you foils any attempt to head back in that direction. The bend of the sea bed allows
      for passage to the north or up to a slightly raised area to the east.
