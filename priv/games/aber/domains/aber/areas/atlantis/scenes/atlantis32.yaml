      You enter into the Atlantis Terrarium. This is where the Atlanteans display some of the creatures that
      live above the water. Each cage is made out of something that looks like a clear glass, but stronger. In
      east of the cages in this half you see some of the more mundane animals: rats, dogs, cats, bats, goats,
      chicken, racoons, snakes, cows, pigs, bears and the like on are display here. A sign near the door
      indicates that they obtain air for them from above the waves and that the animals are treated well. A
      sign indicates that there are more creatures to the west or you may step back outside.
