    short: The Atlantis Library
    sight: >
      You enter a richly furnished library. It seems the inhabitants of this town like books a great deal. The
      walls are lined with books and the floor is covered in an unusual pattern of colored coral in a
      tile-like pattern. Sturdy stone tables are complimented with comfortable sponge chairs. You glance over
      the books in the library and notice that they are all made of a clay-like substance that the words have
      been etched into. You realize that the books being heavy also solves the problem of the books floating
      away. In all, it's a rather unusual library from the ones you are used to, but is quite comfortable and
      inviting.
