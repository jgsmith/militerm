    sight: >
      This street continues along between buildings, providing a fairly wide corridor. The buildings on either
      side seem to be made mostly of a sand-like substance. The building at the end of the street on the left
      looks like it is made from a blue-green material that looks like marble and you guess that it is an
      important building. Fish dart past you on their way to get to somewhere while you're deciding where to
      go. You may return back to Main Street to the east or toward the end of the street to the West.
