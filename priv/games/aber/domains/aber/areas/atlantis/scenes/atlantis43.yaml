    sight: >
      The walls of the castle extend along the western side, save for an opening off to the west, which is
      being guarded. It appears that nobility live in that section and only come out infrequently, though you
      notice a great deal of servants entering. At the moment a swordfish is exiting the passage on his way
      toward the throne room to the east. Following the walls of the castle north you will encounter one of
      the sand towers.
