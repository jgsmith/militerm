      The sea bed declines into a shallow depression here. The water eddys around you in a circular pattern,
      catching fish in the current and tossing them about a bit before they regain control. The currents whirl
      around the depression, disturbing the sand. Off to the east you see a large kelp bed while the prow of a
      large ship lies in wreck to the north. Far off to the west is the abrupt rise of a cliff face while the
      sea bed winds gently of to the south.
