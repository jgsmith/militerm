      This home is extremely immaculate. Everything has its proper place and is stored there neatly. The pots
      are all put away, the gardening utensils are all clean and stored in their rack, the bed is made and the
      floor is swept (as much as the sea floor can be swept, anyway). The entire household is spotless which
      isn't overly surprising since its inhabitant has eight arms to do everything with.
