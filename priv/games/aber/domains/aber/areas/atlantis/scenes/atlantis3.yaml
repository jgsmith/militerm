    sight: >
      As you travel still further down you see the sea floor begin to approach you. You can begin to make out
      some forms on the sea floor below. Off to the north you can see the ruins of a ship while off to the
      east a small town rests peacefully beneath the waves. Beyond the small town you can see the opening of a
      large cave mouth. You can swim upward or descend down to the sea bed.
