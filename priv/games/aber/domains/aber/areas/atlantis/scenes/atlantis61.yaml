    short: Cave Intersection
    sight: >
      As you approach this intersection you are met by the glow generated by a large number of phosphorescent
      plants. They line all the cracks and gullies of the walls you pass by and give a soft but somewhat eerie
      glow to the water before you. This intersection of cave passages leads north into a large crevice, east
      around a corner and south further along the corridor.
