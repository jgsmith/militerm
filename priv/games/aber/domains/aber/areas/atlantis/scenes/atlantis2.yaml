    sight: >
      The blue-green of the sea water embraces you upon your descent. You feel the tug and pull of water
      currents as they gently move you. Small fish dart here and there in front of your eyes, appearing
      somewhat startled by the intrusion upon their domain. Light from above is fading as you descend but your
      eyes are becoming more adjusted to the new environment. You can either swim up or descend further.
