      As you enter this section you can see a group of fish that appear to be playing a game called "airball"
      where they bat around an air-filled ball with their fins and try and knock it into a couple of
      enclosures. It looks like they're having a lot of fun. Passages between the buildings lead north towards
      the end of the street, west down a short street and back south along the rest of Main Street.
