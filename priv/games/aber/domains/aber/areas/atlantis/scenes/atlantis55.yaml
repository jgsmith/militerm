      You enter a home that is jammed with everything imaginable. There are bits of seashell, jade pottery, a
      small glass jar full of pearls, a cracked lamp, and a small stone shelf covered with pieces of coral.
      Small starfish lie on the floor of the home and a couple of unusual looking stones are scattered
      throughout the room. On the far wall of the home is an unusual looking fireplace made of a beautiful
      pink stone. Inside it a fire burns with a blue-green flame. The smooth walls of the home have thousands
      of little hole in them that are packed full of trinkets. A prize flag from a sunken pirate ship lies on
      the floor, pinned down by four huge rocks at the corners. It's a cozy little home, albiet somewhat
      cluttered.
