      The water-filled cave passage turns a plain corner from the north towards the west. The walls are rough
      and broken, especially near the floor of the passage where rubble collects at the bottom of the wall,
      but the walls still form a gentle curve around the bend. To the west you notice a patch of light while
      heading north heads toward a room that looks even more cracked than the current one.
