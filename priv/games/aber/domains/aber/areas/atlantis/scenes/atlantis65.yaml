    sight: >
      While the tunnels you have been recently seeing have been extremely rough, you have just entered a
      tunnel that is completely smooth. The sides of the tunnel have been rubbed smooth by some force.
      Touching the walls gives a glassy feeling to them, even though you know that the walls around you are
      stone. You can swim either north or east along the corridor.
