      It seems that other life has been able to enter the cave and survive here because this small alcove is
      completely covered in sponge. Sponges of all colors can be found here. This cavern might actually be a
      lot of fun if you haven't been beset by sea weed plants, giant squids, were far underwater and inside a
      dark watery cave not knowing what was going to happen. The passage leads back out to the west.
