    sight: >
      The floor of this passage is strewn with large chunks of stone and the walls are scored with large
      cracks, like something powerful had been hitting them fiercely. Rubble litters the floor and several
      other pieces look like they have been crushed into smaller pieces by a tremendous force. It doesn't look
      like a very safe place to be floating around in. You can swim into a large crevice off to the west or
      around a corner to the south.
