    short: Throne Room
    sight: >
      The throne against the center of the far wall is the first thing that captures your attention. It is
      carved out of an enormous black pearl. You probably wouldn't want to meet up with the oyster that
      created that! Carved into the surface of the pearl throne is pictures of historical battles, true loves
      and tragic losses. It is a marvel to behold and the rest of the room no less so. The room is lit by
      phosphorescent fish standing at attention at even intervals throughout the room. The ceiling of the room
      is covered in all the riches of the sea. Brightly colored clownfish do tricks for everyone's amusement
      and there is gaiety all around. The only odd thing about the room is that the floor is completely
      barren. Looking down you see nothing but the sea bed below you.
