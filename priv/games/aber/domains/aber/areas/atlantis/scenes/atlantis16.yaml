    sight: >
      Before you is the fabled city of Atlantis. You can see a large wall made out of some sand-like substance
      enclosing the buildings with a large gate in the middle of the wall directly in front of you. The water
      here is ripe with disturbances in the water from the passage of all sorts of aquatic life that appear to
      be entering the city. The gates are before you to the east while a kelp bed lies to the north and a
      large stone outcropping is to the south. You can also proceed back along the sea bed to the west.
