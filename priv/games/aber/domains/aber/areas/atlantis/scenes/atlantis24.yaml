    sight: >
      Fish dart around the wide open spaces of this temple. Large slabs of a blue-green stone form the walls
      of this octagonal shaped room. In the center of the chamber a large statue of Poseidon dominates the
      room. The floor is covered in a criss-cross pattern of the same sort of material as that which makes up
      the walls. Occassionally, pious aquatic life come and offer their respects and sometimes leave a gift at
      the base of the statue. As you watch, a small shark enters the temple, bows a fin toward the statue and
      then leaves a small piece of beautiful red coral in respect.
