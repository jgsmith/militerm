    short: Cave Corner
    sight: >
      The cave turns a corner here, leading from the west to the south. The water here seems very dead as
      there are few vibrations in the water and you can feel very little current passing by you. You also take
      notice that you haven't seen any aquatic life since you've entered the cave. The thought makes you
      shiver slightly. The cave leads on into darkness to the south or back out towards the cave mouth to the
      west.
