    sight: >
      The lobby area of the inn is rather nice. There are several plush chairs set up for people to sit in
      while they wait, or read the paper, or whatever they wish to be doing. The place is simple but
      tastefully decorated, and seems to be reputable. In the back, a door leads up the stairs to what you
      believe to be rentable rooms. To the east is another doorway that leads into the bar.
