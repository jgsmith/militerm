    short: Secret Storage Room
    sight: >
      Prying the metal sheet off of the stone wall that holds up the jetty, you go into a rather dark and dank
      storage room underneath. The room seems like it hasn't seen the light of day in a very long time. There
      are spiders crawling here and there, but they seem to be the only form of life that has seen this place
      in many many years. There is nothing particularly special about the room. It is carved into the hillside
      and was probably used as a secret storage place long ago for pirated goods. Way off to one corner are
      the remains to what used to be a wooden chest.
