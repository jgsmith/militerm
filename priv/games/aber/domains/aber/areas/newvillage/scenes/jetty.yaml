    sight: >
      You have reached the high point of the hill and are standing on a type of wooden boardwalk, overlooking
      the sea. There is a brisk, warm breeze here that feels refreshing as it blows across your face. Beneath
      you, the hill drops out into the water, which beats against the dirt with an incredible rate. There is a
      little path beside the boardwalk that leads down to a dry patch of sand below the jetty. Toward the
      south, a cliff face stands slightly higher than the boardwalk, with a set of stairs carved into its
      side.
