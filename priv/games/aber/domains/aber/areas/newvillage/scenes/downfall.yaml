    sight: >
      Where you are standing on the path, you are so close to the water that you can feel yourself being
      sprinkled upon by mist from the waterfall. The noise around you is deafening. Fortunately the water is
      far enough away that it is not drenching the path upon which you are walking. Slowly you can work your
      way down the path.
