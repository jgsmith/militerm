    sight: >
      The bar is a dark and smokey place. You take your place at a stool at the bar, which is well-grooved
      from many years of use by passing sailors and travelers alike. The bar seems to serve a wide variety of
      drinks, and you settle down with a beer. Looking around the room, you see local men drinking with their
      friends after a hard day's work, as well as a number of people who, from their shyness, you guess aren't
      from around here. Yet another group of sailors is being rather rowdy at a table nearby.
