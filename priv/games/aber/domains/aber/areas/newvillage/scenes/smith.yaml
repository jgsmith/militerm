    sight: >
      The room you are in is dark and hot and smells of steam, fire, and hot iron. There is a large forge in
      the center of the room that seems to put off quite a lot of heat. There are tools that the Smith made
      for himself lying nearby. The Smith seems to be making a set of horseshoes for a horse that you can hear
      whinnying in an attached stable. There is a large collection of horseshoes hanging on a beam above the
      forge.
