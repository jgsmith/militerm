    sight: >
      You have reached the northern end of this street. Beyond, to the north, there is a river bank, and
      beyond, a large prairie filled with nothing but tall grass. On the other side, in the distance, you can
      see some incredibly large mountains. They seem to be at their most impressive off to the north-east. To
      the west is the locksmith's and to the east is the General Store. The main part of the village is back
      to the south.
