    sight: >
      Here the path starts to climb to the west. You can just barely make out the tops of the tall ships
      harboured at the shipyard. The path climbs west to the open sea, and slopes down to the village in the
      east. To the southwest is a large mill and just to the north, a very old well that looks like it hasn't
      been used in years.
