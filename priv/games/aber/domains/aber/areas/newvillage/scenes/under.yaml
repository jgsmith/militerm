    sight: >
      Under the wooden platform of the boardwalk above, you are standing on a sandy strip of beach that is
      rather hard and packed, as though it is often covered with water. The wall under the jetty is made of
      stone to prevent dangerous erosion. Holding up the sea side of the boardwalk are five tall and stately
      wooden poles, each covered in sea slime up to about four feet.
