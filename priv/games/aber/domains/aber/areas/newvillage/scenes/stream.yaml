    sight: >
      The stream you are standing by could more likely be considered a small river. The water is moving quite
      fast, and you feel that it would probably be unwise to attempt to cross it. The stream seems to flow
      from the north-east and the water is cold. The water carries on to the west, where it seems to pick up
      speed and get louder.
