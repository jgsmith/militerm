    sight: >
      The river is getting ever faster as you head down-stream. The scenery on the opposite side of the river
      is as breath-taking as ever. The mountains you can barely make out are snow-capped; probably year-round.
      Every once in a while, you think you hear a loud noise coming from that general area, but you can't be
      sure. The prairie grass on the other side is teeming with life of all kinds. The sun above is shining
      bright and reflecting off of the river's water. The noise you hear coming from the west seems to be
      getting louder and louder.
