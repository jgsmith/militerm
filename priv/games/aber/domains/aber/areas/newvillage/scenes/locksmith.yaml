      Here, the locksmith makes keys and locks for anyone who wants one. The smith himself seems to be at work
      on a particular key behind the counter. All around you are examples of his work, including a huge key
      hanging on one of the walls that seems a bit frivolous, but perhaps it serves some purpose of which you
      are not yet aware.
