    sight: >
      The waiting room you are standing in displays many kinds of weapons made by the weaponsmith who owns
      this shop. He seems to be skilled in many types of weapons; even some you don't recognize. You can hear
      him working away in the back room. The little door that allows you to go behind the counter is open.
