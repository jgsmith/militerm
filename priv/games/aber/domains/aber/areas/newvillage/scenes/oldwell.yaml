    short: The Village Well
    sight: >
      This well apparently hasn't been used in quite some time. Looking down it you can see that the well is
      dry and about five feet down, someone has blocked the well off with a sturdy metal grate. The old well
      cover is lying nearby; made of a wood that has bleached in the sun.
