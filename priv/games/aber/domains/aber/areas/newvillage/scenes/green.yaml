    short: The Village Green
    sight: >
      You are standing on a large green just south of the Town Hall. The buildings of the town seem to kind of
      surround this green, which serves many purposes among the people of the town. To the south is the
      Blacksmith's shop. There is a path running from east to west through the green that leads west to the
      sea and east to the rest of the village.
