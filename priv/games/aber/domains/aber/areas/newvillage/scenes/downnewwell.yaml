    sight: >
      Ignoring all general rules of safety, you decide to be adventuresome and lower yourself into the well.
      At first you keep your hands on the top of the well for a good grip,but as the well seems to be fairly
      dry, you press your hands and feet against opposite walls and work your way down into the well about 7
      feet. You take your left foot one more step down, and suddenly the well isn't so dry anymore. You lose
      your footing on some slime and fall into the well below. 			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
      					SPLASH!! You find yourself sitting on your butt in about a foot and a half of water. What do you do
      now?
