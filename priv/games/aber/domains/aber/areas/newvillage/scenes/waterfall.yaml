    sight: >
      Beyond you to the west is one of the most breath-taking sights you have ever seen. Here the river gets
      white and foamy as it cascades down a waterfall. Hitting the river below with tremendous force, the
      whole area is alive with the sound of flowing water. Not too far away this rushing water joins the open
      sea in an eroded inlet. There is a rocky path leading down dangerously close to the waterfall.
