    short: Forest Clearing
    sight: >
      You are standing in a clearing in a forest. All around the clearing there are trees that stand as tall
      as giants, this must be a very old forest. To the north you see a large waterfall that seems to go up
      for miles and miles and you stare at it in awe. The clearing becomes smaller and turns into a very large
      path to the east.
