    short: Mountain Plateau
    sight: >
      The view from here is spectacular: To the south spreads out the misty expanse of a plain, and beyond it
      a thick forest. The top of this mountain is flat and rubble-strewn, eroded by decades of wind and storm.
      The only noticeable feature is a fairly large building which squats in the center of the plateau to the
      north. A rocky trail winds its way down into the mist.
