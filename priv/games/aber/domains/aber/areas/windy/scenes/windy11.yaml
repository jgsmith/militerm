    sight: >
      You are walking along a thin trail which runs along the base of the mountain range to the south. High
      above, the rocky crags loom menacingly against the dark sky. A terrible wind blows through here, howling
      at you as it whips at your clothes and hair. The trail leads west and north, towards some low hills.
