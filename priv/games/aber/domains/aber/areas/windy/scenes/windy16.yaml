    sight: >
      You stand in the columned entrance of this building. The ceiling disappears into darkness above.
      Examining the runes which are scrawled on the walls, you deduce that this is the Temple of the Winds. A
      large fire-pit in the floor is intended for offerings, although you would rather light your torch from
      it. The temple continues to the south.
