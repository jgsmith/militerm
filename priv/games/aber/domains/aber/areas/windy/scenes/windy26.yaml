    sight: >
      This is the highest point in the southern mountain range. From here, you see the lands of Mirage laid
      out like a map. The mountains continue to the west, where they turn north and bisect the forest. A
      dwarven citadel is visible in the far northwestern corner of the range. To the direct north are the
      plains, followed by woodlands. A small village is visible beyond that, resting on the edge of an eternal
      snowstorm. To the east is the shoreline of a vast sea, speckled with tiny islands. A set of stairs lead
      down here, while an altar is visible to the north.
