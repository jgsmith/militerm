    sight: >
      This is the main place of worship in the temple, although you don't see very many followers present. A
      large statue, formed to resemble a massive cloud, stands atop a dias in the center of the room. The
      statue seems to have eyes... evil eyes. Corridors lead north, south, east and west.
