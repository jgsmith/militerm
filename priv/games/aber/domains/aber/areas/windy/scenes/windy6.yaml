    sight: >
      You stand on a small hillock overlooking the mist-shrouded plain. In the distant north you spy treetops
      poking out of the fog. Rolling hills become towering mountains farther to the south. The trail widens
      here, splitting to the south and east, where it heads into a small ravine.
