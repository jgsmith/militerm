      You have reached the top of the beanstalk and to your great surprise the tops of the clouds are solid!
      As you look around you notice that the sun is really bright this far up and you realize that the weather
      up here must always be great without any clouds above you to block out the sun. There is a path that
      leads off to the north over the cloudy terrain and you can climb back down the beanstalk if you want to.
