    sight: >
      As you come to your senses for another burst of something that looks as if it could vaguely approach
      reality, you find yourself sitting by a small campfire in the middle of nowhere discussing the finer
      qualities of crossbreeding earthworms with racehorses with several people you have never seen before in
      your life. This, however, doesn't strike you as very inconvenient or unusual because your having a good
      time anyway.
