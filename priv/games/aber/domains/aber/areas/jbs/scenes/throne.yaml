    sight: >
      As you enter this room you are immediately struck by a gigantic &+Ythrone&* made of pure gold! Once you
      manage to tear your eyes away from that huge treasure, you notice many finely woven tapestries and
      banners hung tastefully about the room. There are exit's leading in all directions, and to the east you
      can go out onto the balcony.
