    sight: >
      You have reached a small clearing in the middle of somewhere, and to your surprise you find a group of
      five or six small bears, all different colors ranging from blue to red and green, dancing around and
      grooving to a really tripped out version of what sounds like Dark Star... You have no idea where the
      music might be coming from.
