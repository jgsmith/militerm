    sight: >
      You have reached the lowest possible point of the tunnel. Directly to the south you see an opening that
      is letting in small tufts of cloud. You see many deep claw markings around the edge of the drop off and
      you wonder what could possibly have made them. There is a chamber to the east, or you can go back up the
      tunnel to the north.
