      You are in the deepest inner reaches of this cow pasture. The thick Grass grows almost up to your waist,
      and, to your surprise, there aren't even any flies in here! The grass is soft and gentle and seems to be
      caressing you as you walk through this mystical place. As you look down at your feet you make out
      millions of tiny pinpoints sparkling in myriads of different colors. As you look closer you realize that
      this is just the light sparkling off of the rich soil on the ground.
