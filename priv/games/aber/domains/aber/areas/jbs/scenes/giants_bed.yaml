    sight: >
      This is the giants bedroom. You know this from the mammoth figure who is asleep on the bed about ten
      feet above you and to the west. You can easily walk under it if you want to, or you could even climb up
      the bedpost onto the bed if you want you risk getting that close to the &+ygiant&*. There are also exits
      to the east and south.
