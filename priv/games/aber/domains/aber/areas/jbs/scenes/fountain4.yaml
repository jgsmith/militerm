    short: The Rim of the Fountian
    sight: >
      You are standing on the rim of this huge fountain. The water splashing out from around the fountain
      feels like a gentle spring rain. As you look into the fountain you see a few VERY BIG fish swimming
      around and on the bottom what must be some of the currency of this land.
