    short: The Clock Room
    sight: >
      As you enter you are nearly knocked to the floor by a giant pendulum swinging in front of the door.
      After regaining your balance you look around the room and realize that the whole wall behind you is a
      &+Ygiant clock&*! As you survey the rest of the room you find that it is completely HUNG with clocks of
      all shapes and sizes, and to your surprise they are all set on different times! Every few minutes you
      hear a different clock chime out a different hour.
