    sight: >
      You stand in the center of a large rectangular room with exits in all directions. As you look around
      this place you see several rows of disgusting, lizard-like creatures that could only have come out of a
      horrible nightmare. All of them are strung upside down from the ceiling and most have a person or two
      kneeling on the floor beneath them sucking thick fluids from erect, hollow tubes growing from the heads
      of the creatures. As you look at the people here, you notice that they seem to be enjoying themselves,
      but you also get the feeling that many of them have been here for years.
