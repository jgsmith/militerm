    sight: >
      The path forks here to run east and west around a small, clear fish pond. The trees here have not been
      cleared like they have on the rest of the farm so you cannot see very far along the path in either
      direction, but the sounds of the birds and other small woodland animals living here make you feel at
      ease.
