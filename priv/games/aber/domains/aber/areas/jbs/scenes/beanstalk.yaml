    sight: >
      You are about half way up this huge beanstalk. Small vines and branches grow out everywhere making it an
      easy climb to get the rest of the way up, or you can go back down to the field below you. As you look
      around from here you see a small village off to the south and the vast expanse of the sea to the east.
      To both the north and the west you see a magnificent chain of mountains running in the distance.
