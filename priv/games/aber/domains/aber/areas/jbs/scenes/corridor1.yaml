    sight: >
      This is a large, dim, smoky corridor that is lit by sparsely separated torches that are giving of
      sputtery light and lots of smoke. So much smoke has come from these torches that all of the walls and
      ceilings have been stained black with soot from them. The corridor leads west back to the stairs or east
      through a door deeper into the dungeon. There are also rooms to the north and south.
