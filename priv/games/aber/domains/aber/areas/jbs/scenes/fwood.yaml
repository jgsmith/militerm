      Lost.... You find yourself stumbling through a large, misty wood that seems to extend in all directions
      to infinity. The trees seem to be moving around you opening paths through the thickest brush and closing
      before allowing you to go down the clearest path. The sky above you is fairly visible through the tree
      tops, but as you look up all you see are incredible vortices of swirling color.
