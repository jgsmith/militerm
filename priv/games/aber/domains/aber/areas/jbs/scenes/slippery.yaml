      As you enter this room, you step on a pile of intestines and fall to the floor where you are covered
      with blood and guts. After a few tries you manage to scramble to your feet and maintain your balance.
      The stench of rotten flesh in here is almost overwhelming, and as you examine the many entrails and
      bones lying around the room you notice that they are exclusively human.
