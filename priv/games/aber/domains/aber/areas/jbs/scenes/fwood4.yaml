    sight: >
      You are still in the fairy wood. The mist here is thinner than in other places, but still thick enough
      to make you feel as eerie as everywhere else in this place. There is a small brook here that looks like
      it would be a rather nice place to hang about for a while, if only the water wasn't lime green.
