    sight: >
      As you enter the kitchen you are overwhelmed by the incredible aroma of fresh country cooking. The walls
      in here are covered with beige, flowery wallpaper, and there are all kinds of pots and pans hanging from
      a rack above a counter in the center of the room. Exits lead north, south and east.
