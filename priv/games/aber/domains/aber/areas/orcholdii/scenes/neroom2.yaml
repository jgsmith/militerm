      This room is a bit more finished then the others closer to the entryway. The walls have been smoothed
      and the floor is covered in a lush &+Cfur rug&*. There is a fine suit on the bed, perfectly pressed. The
      &+Cdesk&* however has a fine coating of dust, as if this room hasn't been used recently.
