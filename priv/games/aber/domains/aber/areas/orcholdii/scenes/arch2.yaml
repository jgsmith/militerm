    sight: >
      This is a grand hallway that archs well over your head. The floor is a deep blue quartz and the lights
      are what seem to be magical balls of continual light held in place by silver lanterns. As you look
      around you become certain that this was not constructed by orcish hands. The doorway to the east is
      blocked by yellow tape. On the tape is written, "Do Not Enter." There is a door to the west and the
      grand entry is to the north.
