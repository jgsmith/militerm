      This room appears to be a bit more finished then the others. The walls are smooth, though still just the
      rock of which they were carved. There is a real bed sitting in the middle of the room, it's sheets
      rumpled. From the stench of stale Orc sweat and cigars you have a pretty good idea what occured here.
      You are somewhat thankful you missed it.
