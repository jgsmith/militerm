      You are amazed at the poor quality of the bedroom. It looks to be of the finest orcish make, that is to
      say the walls are somewhat rough and hewn out of the stone. They must not have gotten to this room in
      their remodeling yet. There is a pile of &+Cblankets&* and &+Cstraw&* on the floor that you take is the
      bed and an open &+Cwardrobe&* filled with &+Cdresses&* that look very un-orcish.
