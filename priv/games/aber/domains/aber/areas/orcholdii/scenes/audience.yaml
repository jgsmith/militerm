      It appears no expense was spared in preparing this room. The entire room is done in black marble and
      there are tapestries looted from some of the finest castles adorning the walls. There is a chandalier
      hanging from the ceiling and there are more of those magical balls of light about the room. On the west
      wall is a massive dias with two thrones on it. One is large, twice the size of the orc and obviously
      intended for the Queen. The other is just a glorified chair intended for the King, though from the coat
      of dust on it, he rarely uses it prefering his old audience chamber. There is a door to the south and
      the hallway leads back to the east.
