    sight: >
      This is a grand hallway that archs well over your head. The floor is a soothing white marble and the
      light is provided by what seem to be smokeless torches set in pure gold sconces. You are almost positive
      that dwarves were behind such magnificent craftmanship. There are doors east and west and the hallway
      continues to the north.
