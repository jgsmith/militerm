    sight: >
      Compared to the other rooms you have passed through, this chamber seems almost modest. There is a
      four-poster queen sized canopy bed along the west wall. Next to the bed is a small &+Cnight stand&* and
      along the north wall is a large &+Cwardrobe&*. It looks like the only exit is back the way you came.
