      This room appears to be a bit more finished then the others. The walls are smooth, though still just the
      rock of which they were carved. There is a real &+Cbed&* sitting in the middle of the room properly
      made. The room itself is immaculate in its cleanliness and you wonder that an orc lives here at all.
