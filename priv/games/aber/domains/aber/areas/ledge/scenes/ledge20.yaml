    short: Sloping Tunnel
    sight: >
      The steepness of this tunnel gets to be a little tricky to walk on. If the floor was a little more
      steeper you could have been climbing down the tracks like a ladder. Man, if only you had a cart to
      travel down the track instead! You can continue moving downward or else start climbing back up.
