    sight: >
      You seem to have stumbled into the home of a large bear. The fact that this bear hasn't attacked you yet
      is that this bear seems to be chained down. There seems to be another room behind the bear, but it
      appears the way is blocked unless you can figure out a way to get past him. You can get away from this
      bear to the south.
