    short: Lagoon in the Cavern
    sight: >
      An opening in the floor filled with water can be seen here. Dipping your hand and tasting it tells you
      that it's salty and that means that lagoon connects itself with the sea! Underwater cave explorers must
      have been here in the past as some of their instruments seem to have been left behind. For those who
      just came up into this cavern, well take a tour to the north and west or else jump back into the water
      and head east.
