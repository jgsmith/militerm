    sight: >
      Whoa! You seem to have some upon some sort of demon's cave! And as you can see, it's very warm and
      bright in here! On top of that, a rather noisy bunch of blabber echos in here, yet doesn't leave this
      room. What's worse, a battle seems to have erupted in your head. You begin to express the darkest
      feelings and emotions from your heart. The sight and the sound of dark emotion have infected your mind,
      so much so that you have become paralyzed and are slowly being consumed by it. Better do something to
      get away from this manifestation, or you're done for. If you were able to move, you can head west, east
      or south.
