    short: Old Mining Tunnel
    sight: >
      The smell of minerals begins to permeate your nose as you progress. The walls of this tunnel appear to
      have been chipped into with pickaxes in search for gold or diamonds. Alas, all that could be found were
      coal deposits. Some chunks of it litter the sides of the tunnel, which continues downward. Those afraid
      of exploring may exit upward to the west.
