    short: Underground Geyser
    sight: >
      A sizeable crack in the floor in this section of the cave spews hot water and steam effectively heating
      up a good part of the whole cavern. The tunnel seems to go back a lot further, but getting by the geyser
      is too difficult. It's a bit too uncomfortable in this suana and best to head away to the west.
