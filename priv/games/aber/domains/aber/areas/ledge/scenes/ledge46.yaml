    sight: >
      The undersea clifflines streches for some unknown distance to the south, yet the ocean current pushes
      you toward the side of the rock. Better hope a storm isn't coming up while you're down here. You can
      swim away from the cliff east, swim toward on opening north, follow the cliff some more south, or climb
      out of the water upward.
