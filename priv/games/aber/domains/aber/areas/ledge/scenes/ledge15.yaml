    short: Old Mining Tunnel
    sight: >
      The northern tunnel you are now treking through appears to have been dug where a large portion of the
      coal deposit was located. The width of the tunnel appears to indicate that the miners did a little too
      much digging along the sides making it easier for a ceiling collapse. The tunnel continues a little
      further downward while you can return back south.
