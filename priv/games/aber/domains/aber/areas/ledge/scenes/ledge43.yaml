    sight: >
      It's gotten a bit brighter, as the cave appears to open up to the wide ocean to the east. Looking to the
      west the cavern looks to go back a ways and gets narrower. Seems to be an excellent place for underwater
      tunnel exploration. Several kinds of sea animals seem to be living in this cave.
