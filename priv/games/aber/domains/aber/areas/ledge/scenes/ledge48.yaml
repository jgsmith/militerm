    sight: >
      The underwater current of the ocean pushes against the side of the underwater cliff, making scuba diving
      a dangerous activity in calm weather, deadly in stormy weather. The cliff curves to the east here
      following the edge of the klint. Exploring the sea can be done south and east.
