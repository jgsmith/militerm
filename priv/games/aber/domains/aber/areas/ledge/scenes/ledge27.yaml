    short: Glowing Tunnel
    sight: >
      Something seems odd here. Unlike the rest of the tunnels, the walls give off a bit of a glow. Also it is
      quite a bit warmer and humid. Almost like a steam bath. There looks to be a pool to the south, and
      something that appears to be the source of the heat lies to the north.
