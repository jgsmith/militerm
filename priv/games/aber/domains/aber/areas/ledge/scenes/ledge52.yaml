    short: Beachfront Shack
    sight: >
      It's simple-looking shack built along the beach shore as a place to escape the daily barrages of
      adventuring. A large window faces the ocean, where you can watch the waves and the sunrise. A rather
      comfortable-looking bed has been set up for wedded couples for overnight stay. The beach can be set out
      upon to the south.
