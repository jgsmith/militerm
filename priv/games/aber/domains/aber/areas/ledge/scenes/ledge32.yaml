    sight: >
      The rather level floor of the cavern comes to a short climbable wall looking to be about four feet high
      which appears to be another tunnel going to the north. Some track can be seen going to and from this
      tunnel, along with a few droppings of some animal. Perhaps someone or something is living down here
      after all. You can follow the tracks to the north, or else go to other parts of the cavern west and
      south.
