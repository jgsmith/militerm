    sight: >
      You stand at the base of a tremendous tower which is even taller than the black tower to the west. A
      raw, dark energy seems to surge down upon you from the top of the tower, and orange flashes flicker high
      above you. A small ladder ascends to the top of the tower, and an archway leads back to the west.
