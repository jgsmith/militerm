      This is a small stream which flows from east to west through a low cavern. The water in this cavern
      glows as if it were liquid energy. The air here is charged with the kind of excitement that one finds
      after a spring thunderstorm. To the west lies a large cavern which is filled with a light so bright it
      seems to blot out its dark walls.
