    short: Small Room
    sight: >
      This is a small room which seems to serve no particular purpose, save to to immortalize the creator of
      this realm and connect a guard room to the rest of the castle. The walls in this room are completely
      blank, and even devoid of any color, except for a painting of a small, green iguana in the corner of the
      room. Exits lead north and east.
