    sight: >
      This is a narrow dark hole carved out of solid granite. It looks as if it was hollowed out with crude
      tools. You traverse the depths by way of a ladder-like structure etched into the rocks. Below, small
      pebbles dislodge from the movement of your feet against the crumbling, granite ladder disapears deep
      into an abyss-like blackness, with no sound of hitting bottom.
