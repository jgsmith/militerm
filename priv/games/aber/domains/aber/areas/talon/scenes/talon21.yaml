    sight: >
      This is a smaller cavern which has no apparent exit, save the opening you entered from. The walls in
      this cave seem to be covered with strange markings. The markings appear to show a sort of battle which
      takes place between a warrior and a terrifying-looking black dragon. In one drawing, the warrior is
      slaughtered by the dragon, and in another, the warrior defeats the dragon while wearing an odd-looking
      shield. For some reason, the warrior seems strangely familiar.
