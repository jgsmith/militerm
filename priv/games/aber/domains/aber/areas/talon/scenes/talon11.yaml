    sight: >
      You enter a long cave, with a low ceiling and walls etched with strange markings. Water drips slowly to
      the floor from stalactites in the ceiling, and forms stalagmites, which makes passage through the cavern
      difficult. A strange white light shines thorugh the stalactites and stalagmites to give the ghostly
      appearance of passing through the mouth of a tremendous dragon.
