    sight: >
      You enter a dim cave, and reach forward to crawl into the cavern, only to find you are grasping thin air
      while plummeting to your death in a black pit at breakneck speed. You lose consciousness, and never even
      feel your bones shatter into thousands of pieces as your life finds its destiny at the hands of cold,
      twisted rocks.
