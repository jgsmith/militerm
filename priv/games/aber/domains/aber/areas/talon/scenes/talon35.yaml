    sight: >
      You stand in the center of a huge hall. A cathedral ceiling spans far above you, and the walls are lined
      with stunning oil paintings of magnificent dragons. Every step you take upon the black marble floor
      echoes like thunder around the room, and you are startled by the sound of your own breathing as the
      tension is so thick you can almost taste it. Archways lead in all directions from here.
