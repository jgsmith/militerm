    short: Cavern into the Unknown
    sight: >
      You stand in a wide cavern with a soft sandy floor. To the western side of the cavern, a strange dim
      white light pours from what appears to be some kind of shifting gateway into the unknown. The porthole
      is like a distorted mirror, fluctuating at every instant in size and shape, and it casts strange white
      waves of light across the cavern as it changes in shape. To the east lies the underground lake.
