    sight: >
      You stand at the gates of a large, black castle. You are in the midst of the suffocating, black haze
      which rains down upon this land. An air of impeding evil weighs down heavily upon your soul as you scan
      the length of this monstrous castle. Down below, the landscape stretches out before you, and for a
      moment, light seemed to reflect from a tall mountain in the distance, but then a cloud of smog drifts
      before your eyes. To the east lie the tremendous gates to a castle which is most certainly responsible
      for the demise of this land.
