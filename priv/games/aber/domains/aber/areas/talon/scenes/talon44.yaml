    short: Base of Tower
    sight: >
      You stand at the base of a tall black tower. As you look up, a sense of great evil overwhelms you. A
      sense of deep, dark magic seems to emanate from the top of the tower. There is a spiral staircase
      leading up from here, and archways lead east and west.
