    sight: >
      You stand at the peak of the tallest mountain in the land. To the east, a large canyon separates two
      tremendous mountain ranges. Even further to the east, the landscape seems to fade into a shade of black,
      darker than onyx. You can barely make out the shape of a large dark castle atop a huge black mountain on
      the horizon. To the west, a deep blue ocean beats endlessly upon the cliffs of a mountain range lining
      its shores. As you look, you feel as if one small jump could take you to the ends of the earth from
      here. To the north, a strangely blank cliffside juts up above you.
