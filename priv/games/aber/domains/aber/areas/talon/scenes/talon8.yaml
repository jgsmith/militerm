      This appears to be the end of an incredible descent into the depths. You are peering down into a large
      cavern below, which seems to be alive with movement. The entire cavern beneath is bathed in a dark
      orange glow, which makes it difficult to distinguish living figures from shadows flitting in the
      torchlight. It seems as if you could make your way down the sides of the cave, to the bottom. To the
      west, a small crack, just wide enough to fit through, leads off into the darkness. Above, the shaft
      leads back to a world that is but a quickly fading memory in the somber blackness of the new realm you
      have discovered.
