    sight: >
      You stand in the center of a large cavern, which appears to have formed naturally from the movement of
      an underwater stream, flowing from a waterfall halfway up the side of the cavern. Torches line the
      walls, and cast an eerie orange glow over the entire cave. The roof is smoked black from the numerous
      torches scorching its surface. The underground stream disapears into a small cave to the west. To the
      south, a small crack wide enough to squeeze through leads into the blackness. To the east, cool air
      seems to pour through a large opening leading to another cave.
