    sight: >
      You enter a small room which appears to end to the east in a mirror-like porthole. White light travels
      across the porthole in the area, like lightning on a dark, stormy summer's sky. Beyond the brilliant
      white light on the surface of the gateway, a strange evil darkness seems to emanate. It is hard to
      distinguish if it is a physical, or spiritual darkness which you seem to sense. Back to the west lies
      the safety of the known world.
