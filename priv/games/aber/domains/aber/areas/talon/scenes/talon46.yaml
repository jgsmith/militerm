      You enter a small, dark room which appears to be where the ruler of this castle practices his dark
      magic. A sense of terrifying chaos resounds in this room whose walls must have horrifying tales to tell.
      There is a large throne on the east wall, and strategic charts line the walls. The charts seem to tell
      of a plan to use a deadly beast and portholes into another dimension to conquer the world you call home.
