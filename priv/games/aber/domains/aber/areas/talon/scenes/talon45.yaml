    sight: >
      You stand at the top of a tall spiral staircase. A trememdous red door lies on the east wall. A chill
      runs down your spine as a sense of foreboding evil completely overpowers all of your senses. There is an
      almost blindking darkness which enshrouds the entire room. You may retreat to the safety of the known
      points of the castle below, or venture into the unknown through doors to the east.
