    short: Standing on a Beach
    sight: >
      You stand at the edge of a deep, blue sea; waves beat endlessly on the bone-white sand upon these
      shores. To the west, a column of water rises from the ocean, and dissapears into a bright, white
      porthole. The beach stretches out before you, along the edges of a towering mountain range lining its
      shores. To the east, a small cave leads into the side of the cliff.
