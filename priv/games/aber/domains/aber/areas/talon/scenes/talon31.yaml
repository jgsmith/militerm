    sight: >
      You are now in a dark valley, on a small path traversing this barren landscape. The skies are filled
      with a dark haze which seems to become even more black and evil as you travel to the east. All around
      you, shadows seem to dance around the edges of the fading red light, as if anticipating the overcoming
      darkness. To the west, a dark foothill looms before you, as if suspended in the darkness. To the east,
      you can make out a large black castle built on the side of a towering mountain peak.
