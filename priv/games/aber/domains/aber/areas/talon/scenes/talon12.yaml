    sight: >
      You are waist deep in ice cold water which rushes quietly past you to the west into the blackness. The
      sharp rocks underneath the water cut and grab at your feet to make passage treacherous. On a dry ledge
      to the north, a small hole, barely passable, leads into the unknown.
