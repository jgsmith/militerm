    short: Edge of Sinkhole
    sight: >
      You stand at the edge of a massive pit in the center of the cavern. Closer observation reveals it is a
      sinkhole from this cave to another. You might just be able to climb down the sides to the waves crashing
      below. To the east a small cave dissapears into the shadows.
