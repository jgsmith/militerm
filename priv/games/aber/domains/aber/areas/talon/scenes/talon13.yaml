    short: Underground Lake
    sight: >
      The cavern opens up into a tremendous underground lake, and although some small ripples are caused by
      the incoming stream, it is as calm, and as clear as finely polished glass. The entire cave glows from
      waves of light emanating from an exit to the far southern side of the lake, which are reflected from the
      water across to the walls and cave's ceiling. To the west is a small cave preceeded by a shore of rocks
      and moist clay. To the south, water from the lake continues its underground journey in a small stream,
      and to the east, water empties into the lake from a small cave.
