    short: Top of the Glacier
    sight: >
      This is the top of a large glacier that extends down the steep mountainside. The fresh snow here looks
      good for skiing. Of course you'd best be careful or you might set of an avalanche. To the south you can
      barely make out the bottom of the glacier through the glare from the snow. West of here lies the fells.
