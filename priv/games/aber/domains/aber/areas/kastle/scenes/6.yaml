    short: Royal Bedroom
    sight: >
      A sense of awe briefly overcomes you at the splendor of the royal bedroom. Gold seems to guild
      everything here. Even the ceiling is inlaid with gold patterns surrounding the splendid royal seal. The
      bed, perhaps the largest you have ever seen, is covered with sheets of luxurious gold silk. You get the
      impression that this king was a little obsessed with his gold.
