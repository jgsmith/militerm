    short: Long Cold Passageway
    sight: >
      This passageway is filled with cold air that goes right through your clothes and makes you shiver
      uncomfortably. The heavy frost that has collected on the walls reminds you of an icebox that hasn't been
      cleaned out in years. To the north you can just make out the light of the many torches that line the
      walls there, and to the south there is a small light at the end of the tunnel.
