      You are in a cozy little room inside the royal hideout. The west wall is hung with a large colorful
      tapestry meant to depict the heroic deeds of the royal family. Oddly enough, however, it is completely
      blank. The east wall is occupied by a huge fireplace in front of which sits the royal Lazy-boy, a chair
      fit for a king.
