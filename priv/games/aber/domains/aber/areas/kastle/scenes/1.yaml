      The Passage opens up here allowing you to stand. There are lit torches spaced evenly along both walls
      providing plenty of light to see by. Much further to the south the torches end, and it appears that
      someone is standing there by a door. The floor here is dirt, but oddly enough your footsteps sound
      hollow.
