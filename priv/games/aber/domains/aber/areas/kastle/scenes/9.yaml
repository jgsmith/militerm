    short: The Fells
    sight: >
      The escape passage emerges here high on the side of a steep rocky fell. The footing here is treacherous.
      Small avalanches of scree are set off by your footsteps as you scramble along the fell. Any descent
      would be impossible. The only other way out is up to the top of the fell which is covered in snow.
