      The large room hung completely in black with an enormous stave of music containing the notes of the Dies
      Irae many times repeated. Off to one side of the room there is a canopy, from which hangs curtains of
      red brocaded material, and, under the canopy, an open coffin. An enormous organ covers one entire wall.
      Against the far wall is a dais, upon which sits a black throne.
