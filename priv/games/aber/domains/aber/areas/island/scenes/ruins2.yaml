    short: Desolate Ruins
    sight: >
      You are standing in the desolate ruins of what was perhaps once a harbour. The sea now breaks over the
      low crumbling stone wall which must once have been a jetty of some sort. Thick tangled bushes extend
      north and east following the ruins to the edge of a huge lava flow. To the south a narrow trail leads
      into thick vegetation.
