    sight: >
      You stand on the brink of an ancient volcanic crater. The ground around you trembles and shakes to the
      accompaniment of a steady rumbling from beneath your feet. A huge black slab stands on the very edge of
      the crater marked with many hideous symbols and shapes. A narrow staircase leads downwards beside the
      slab.
