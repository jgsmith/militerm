    sight: >
      You stand in the center of what must once have been a huge ampitheatre, with high columned arches
      surrounding it. Thick heavily tangled bushes grow all around the stumps of the many fallen pillars,
      frequently hiding them from view. The ruins extend back westwards, but to the south and east have been
      covered by huge lava flows.
