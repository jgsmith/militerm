    sight: >
      You are swimming in wonderful warm water. The high waves aren't disturbing you in any way. When you look
      in the north and south directions, they don't look so horrible, but many turbulences and sharp rocks are
      there. As you see further to the east, you see something huge lying on an island. You can't imagine what
      it could be.
