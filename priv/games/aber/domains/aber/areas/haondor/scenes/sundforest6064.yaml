    short: A Shadowy Path Through The Dense Forest
    sight: >
      You are on a small shadowy path leading through the dense forest. The crowns of the old trees leave the
      forest in an unreal twilight illumination. The path continues north and south, ending at a fence for
      what appears to be an old forgotten graveyard.
