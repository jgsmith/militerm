    short: The Lower Part Of The Grassy Field
    sight: >
      You are in a lower part of the grassy field, south of a small lake. The &+Ggrass&* here has been
      trampled by the many animals coming here for water, leaving the ground covered in tracks of different
      types. To the west you see a break in the wall of trees surrounding the field, and to the north is a
      small lake.
