    short: Midway To The Top Of The Large Oak
    sight: >
      You are in a huge oak, about midway to the top. The branches above you block out much of the light, but
      enough filters through for you to see. A few &+Cbirds&* have remained to watch you from the fringe
      branches, well out of your reach. Scratches mar the tree here, and torn bark is scattered near you on
      the branch. It would seem some large forest cat lives nearby, so you had better be careful! You can
      continue a bit farther &+Cup the tree, or descend to limbs that don't sway so much.
