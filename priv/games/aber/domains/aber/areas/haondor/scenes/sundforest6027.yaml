      You are in the middle of a small &+Blake&*, fed from a small stream coming through the forest from the
      northwest. The water is not that clear, but you can see fish swimming around below you. The bank is
      clear to the south, providing a safe place to get back to the field. The &+Gtrees&* and the &+yreeds&*
      are abundant.
