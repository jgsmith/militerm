    short: Off Of The Path In The Shaded Forest
    sight: >
      You are wandering amongst the trees in the light forest, without the aid of a path or trail. More
      sunlight trickles through the treetops here, making your travel a bit easier. Small animals scurry away
      as you approach. You are no longer on a path, so you may go whichever way you please.
