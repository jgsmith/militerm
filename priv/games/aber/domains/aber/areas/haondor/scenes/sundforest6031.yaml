    sight: >
      This sturdy branch hangs far out over a path to the west, which you might be able to jump down to.
      Several squirrels scamper into hiding as you approach, leaving you alone and swaying slightly with the
      wind. To your north you can see a small log cabin through the trees, and to the southeast there seems to
      be some sort of clearing, with many birds circling above it.
