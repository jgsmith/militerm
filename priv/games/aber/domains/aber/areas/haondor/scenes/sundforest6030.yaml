    short: In The Lower Branches Of A Large Oak
    sight: >
      You are in a huge oak, about one third of the way to the top. The branches above you block out much of
      the light, but enough filters through for you to see. Small animals and birds scatter at your approach,
      rustling the leaves all about you. You could easily climb back down to the ground, or continue up the
      tree. One large branch juts outward to the west, possibly providing a third choice of exit.
