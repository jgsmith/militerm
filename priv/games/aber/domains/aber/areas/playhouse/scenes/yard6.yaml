      This is a nice large playpen with a fine layer of sand covering most of the grass within the plastic
      mesh walls. You look down to see that the ground is littered with toy fire engines, toy ambulances, hot
      wheel cars, transformers, and many other favorite children's toys. To the east is the children's picnic
      area.
