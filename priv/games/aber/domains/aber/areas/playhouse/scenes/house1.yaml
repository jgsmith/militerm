      The glass windows next to the huge oak door let in a good amount of light that allows the ferns hung in
      front of them to flourish. You look down and smile as you wipe your feet off on the welcome mat
      (manners!). The coatrack to the left of the door has several children's jackets hanging from it along
      with an adult one. The house is to the east or you can leave to the west.
