      What could possibly be going through your head to venture up into the attic? It is cold and dreary up
      here and very little light is up here. You hear scratching yet see nothing that causes it. There are
      boxes upon boxes of junk cluttering the rooms up here. Where could all of this stuff come from? The
      attic continues to the west, or you can return to the house by going down.
