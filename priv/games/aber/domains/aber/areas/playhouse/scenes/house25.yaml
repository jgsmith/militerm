    short: Kids Closet
    sight: >
      At first look this appears to be a simple kids closet. Yet upon closer look you see there is a way up to
      the attic here. There are clothes blocking you from seeing too much in this messy place. It is
      definately owned by a child. All of the clutter proves it.
