    short: Nap Room
    sight: >
      There are little matpads scattered around the room with huge pillows set at the head of each of them. A
      thin, but warm looking blanket also covers the soft matpads. There is a clock on the wall for the
      children to stare at to pray that their naptime goes by quickly so that they can go back outside and
      play. This room actually makes you long for a nice relaxing nap. There are exits in all directions.
