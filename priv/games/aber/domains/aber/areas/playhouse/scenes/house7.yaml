      Hrrrrrmmmmmmm, Do you really need to have this room described to you? There is a little baby changing
      table folded up against one wall. There seems to be a bucket full of lemony smelling soapy water sitting
      on the floor next to the changing table. On shelves rest clean &+Wwhite&* diapers folded neatly and
      stacked in stacks. Clean baby outfits are folded up and stacked on other shelves. The exit to this room
      is east into the sitting room.
