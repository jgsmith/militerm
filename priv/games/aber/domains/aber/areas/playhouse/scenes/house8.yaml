    sight: >
      There is a HUGE couch sitting against one wall. A chair has been placed in an ideal position for chating
      with anyone sitting on the couch. There is another chair positioned opposite the first so that it makes
      a cosy little area for sitting a talking. There is writing on the wall in &+Rred&* crayon. You wonder
      who could have done such a thing. Upon closer examination you notice the letter &+R'P' &*and a letter
      &+R'E' &*written in a little childs barely discernable handwriting. The exits are west, east and north.
