      Here we have a huge set of swings. The a-frame pipes are painted &+Rred&* and &+Wwhite&* like a
      &+Rc&+Wa&+Rn&+Wd&+Ry &+Wc&+Ra&+Wn&+Re&*. The swing seats are &+Bblue&* and the empty ones are swaying
      gently in the breeze. There are even a few baby seats that are &+Ggreen&* in color. The north is blocked
      off by a chainlink fence that surrounds the entire yard keeping the children in. To the west is the
      jungle gym. To the east is the teeter-totters. To the south is the middle of the yard.
