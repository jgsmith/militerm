    sight: >
      This room looks designed with a purpose in mind, and that was to be used by a baby. There are spit-up
      rags cleaned and folded on shelves along with blankets and various other baby items. You look closer and
      see a beautiful little dress waiting for a child here. You know whoever ends up with this room is going
      to be one lucky little baby. The only exit from this room is to the east back into the master bedroom.
