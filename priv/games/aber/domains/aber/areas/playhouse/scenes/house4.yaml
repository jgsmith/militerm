      Ahhhhh, the ever needed Bathroom. The floor is black and white linolium. The walls are covered with
      pretty flowered wall paper. The sink has a bottle of pump hand soap sitting next to it. Pretty &+Yyellow
      flowers&* sit in a vase while the sun shines in from the windows. The curtains are made of &+Yyellow
      cloth&* and has beautiful &+Wwhite&* lace on the edges. The bathroom just wouldn't be a bathroom without
      a &+Ctoilet&*. The toilet is made of fine porcelain. The only exit from this room is back east.
