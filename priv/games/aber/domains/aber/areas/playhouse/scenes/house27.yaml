      This is TERRIBLE!! Reminding you of what you used to think of the attic when you were barely knee-high
      to a grasshopper. The rooms have a very ominous quality to them. The hair on the nape of your neck
      stands on end just thinking there is still more left to look at. The attic continues to the west and
      east from here.
