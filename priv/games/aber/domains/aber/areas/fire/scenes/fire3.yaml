      You are standing in the kitchen. It is very clean, because Sir Gruoch has control over his cooks. It is
      equipped like any normal kitchen with an oven, cupboards, cold store, and a sink for dishes. There is
      also a small lift coming through the floor directly from the food store in the cellar. The ceiling,
      floor, and walls are &+wwhite&*, there is no special decoration. The only exit is back to the entrance
      hall.
