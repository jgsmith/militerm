      You are in the living room. It is terribly &+Rhot&* here, you shouldn't stay here for a long time. There
      are clouds of &+wsmoke&*, so you can't see much except the source of the heat. The fireplace is standing
      against the door, which was totally smashed by the explosion. The small camin door is crap. Gas powered
      &+rflames&* are trying to come out and burn everything around. The only way out is back to the entrance
      hall.
