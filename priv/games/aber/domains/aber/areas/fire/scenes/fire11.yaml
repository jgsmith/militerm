      You are standing in Gruoch's workroom. As you can see to be ranked as a Knight is not only fun, but hard
      administrating work too. But in this time it is looking very chaotic. Papers are laying all around,
      under a hill of papers you can see a desk and a &+Cbed&*. Sir Gruoch is totally down of missing his son.
      He paid so much money already to everyone who said he will look for his son, but no responce untill now.
      You can go back to the living room.
