    sight: >
      You are standing in the village, where robbers are living. All buildings are very simple built, mostly
      made of wood. There are fires burning everywhere, so it isn't so cold here. You can hear some music,
      loud voices coming from the greatest hut to the south of the circle. Also you can try to look in other
      smaller huts.
