      You are standing in the Gerst's playroom. It is a quite large room with &+ywooden&* furniture. Also
      floor and walls are covered with &+ywood&*. There is a comfortable &+Cbed&* in the northeast corner with
      white silk sheets. Pillows and covers are hidden during the day, so the small Sir can play on the bed.
      There are many toys lying around the bed. Cupboards are full of toys too. There is a table at the west
      wall. There is some school stuff on it. You notice that there is a small bell above the door for calling
      servants. You can go west to the living room or south into the bathroom.
