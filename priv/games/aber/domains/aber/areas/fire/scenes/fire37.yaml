    sight: >
      You are standing in the huge hut. You see many robbers here. They are celebrating a good trip. They have
      captured the son of one of the most richest people in the land. You see many tables full with half eaten
      food and lot of empty bottles of vine and beer. There is a tall totaly drunk robber sitting (laying) on
      his some kind of &+ythrone&*. He is so drunk so he is not mentioning you. Also only some of other
      robbers mentioned you, but you don't think that they will be able to do anything against you. Exit leads
      to north.
