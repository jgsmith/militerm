      You are in a rectangular hall, with smooth stone walls, and a marble floor. An overwhelming sense of
      satisfaction fills the air in this room. Twelve marble pillars line the eastern and western walls of the
      chamber. At the northern end of the hall is a dais, made from a single round slab of pure gold. There is
      a crystal pedestal in the center of the dais. To the south is a heavy wooden door, made of cedar and
      overlayed with gold.
