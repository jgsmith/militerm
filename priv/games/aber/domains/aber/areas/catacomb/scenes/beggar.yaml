    sight: >
      You are in a large, rectangular room. There is a feeling of anticipation to this place. Doorways lead in
      all directions, above each is an inscription. The northern inscription reads "Charity", the eastern says
      "Faith", to the south lies "Wisdom", and "Courage" can be found to the west. It seems there is no "Hope"
      ... A spiral staircase runs up and down in the north-east corner of the room.
