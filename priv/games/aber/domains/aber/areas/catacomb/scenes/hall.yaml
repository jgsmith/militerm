    sight: >
      You are in a large, oval-shaped chamber. Tapestries, depicting scenes of single combat, hang from the
      roof of the chamber, which is high overhead. A vast array of weapons and armor, from various ages, adorn
      the walls all about you. The arena is ringed with torches, burning silently. There is an archway leading
      south. There is a heavy wooden door, made of cedar and overlayed with gold, at the northern end of the
      Hall.
