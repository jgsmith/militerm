    sight: >
      You are standing in a small, subterranean chamber. Set into the walls at regular intervals are deep
      recesses, within which lie the stone tombs of a generation long since departed. A gentle breeze blows in
      from the passage to the north, while dark hallways lead south, east, and west. A spiral staircase fills
      one corner of the room.
