    sight: >
      An artificial light fills your eyes as you look round this place. It has been cut into the cliff and is
      completely inside it. The stone walls round the lower part of the arena stand some 30 feet up, to the
      lowest viewing area. The roof, also made of stone, is extremely high, and you dare not guess at it's
      exact height. The air in here is dry, and a little stale, the ground hard. A little dust floats into the
      air as you move.
