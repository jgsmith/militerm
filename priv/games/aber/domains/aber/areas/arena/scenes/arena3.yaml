    short: The Arena
    sight: >
      The arena extends north, east and west from here. A small draft comes from the south, carrying an evil
      chill from behind a set of large steal bars. The air is thick, and shimmers something like it does on
      extremely hot days but this is clearly from the presense of a strong anti-magic field. Possibly to keep
      whats behind those bars in. The seats above here have been placed behind a strange, clear type of rock,
      that allows light, but air to pass.
