      You stand in a strange looking room, most definately magical, for it does not seem to have any walls, or
      floor or roof, or anything much for that matter. It just is. Or is it? Maybe your imagining this. There
      are no exits, as you know them, but then again, there is nothing apparently stopping you from going any
      way in which you please, except, you can't quite tell which ways is which.
