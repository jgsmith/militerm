    sight: >
      There are a few large boulders blocking the way south of here, far to large for any mortal to consider
      moving. They appear to have fallen from the roof above. You sure hope one don't fall on you. There is a
      small bush growing against the northern wall, and a pleasant smell in the air. You feel a little
      strange.
