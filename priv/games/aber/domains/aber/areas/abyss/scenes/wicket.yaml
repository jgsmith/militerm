      The spider webs cover everything here. If you were a spider, it would would be easy to get around,
      otherwise the only way you could go and not get caught in the webs is northward, into a dark smelly
      tunnel. You could also climb up a single strand of webbing that hangs down directly over the tunnel. Or
      you could cross the bridge back to the south.
