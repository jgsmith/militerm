    sight: >
      You stand on the doorstep of someone's private quarters. From a small window a dim light shines through
      heavy curtains. On the heavy wooden front door is carved the number 666. The door has no handle, just a
      small slot in the middle. A door bell is mounted on the doorjam. At the side of the porch a set of short
      steps leads downward.
