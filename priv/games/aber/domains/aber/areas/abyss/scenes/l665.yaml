      This is the next to last level of the Abyss. Below you, you can just make out the floor of the Abyss. To
      the north a tunnel has been bored into the rock. Words cut into the rock next to the entry remove all
      doubt who dwells here: I, Guxx Unfufadoo, rule this region soon your head I'll be a squeezin' A gap in
      the stairs above you prevents you from going up.
