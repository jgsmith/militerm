    sight: >
      You are at the face of an enormous curved basalt cliff that extends down out of sight into a dark pit. A
      small sign, hand painted in blood, tells you: Mortals keep out! A black door set into the face of the
      cliff has a dark arrow above it pointing down. A sign pasted on the door informs you the elevator is out
      of order. For those hearty souls, a large, circular stairway has been carved into the cliff face,
      allowing you to make the long descent into the black pit.
