      You stand at the beginning of rows of what could only be described as carnival booths. Dark secretive
      people walk in and out of the booths and up and down the thoroughfare. Salesmen hawking their wares try
      to outshout each other as the people pass by. There are booths to the north and south, or you can
      continue east.
