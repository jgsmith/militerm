    short: Stinky Tunnel
    sight: >
      The tunnel here feels close and uncomfortable. The air is filled with the stench of filth and decayed
      remains which wafts from a very narrow shaft in the side of the tunnel. To the north the tunnel widens
      into a room and a sense of great evil comes from that direction.
