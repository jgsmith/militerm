      This place has an unnatural, sepulchral quietness to it. The ceiling of the vast chamber is supported by
      regularly spaced massive columns. The columns are carved with the contorted faces of demons. The ground,
      dry and dusty, is littered with dead leaves, which flutter slightly in an occasional light breeze.
