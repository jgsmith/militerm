    sight: >
      You are moving slowly down the River Styx. The water gives off a foul odor and looks just as bad. It
      appears to boil in places and its color is a mixture of grayish brown and yellow. Even though the water
      moves slowly here, movement upstream would be impossible without supernatural help.
