      Nearly at the bottom now, you have made it to the 664th level of the Abyss. In the western face of the
      pit is a heavy iron door with a massive lock. A sign on the door announces: None shall pass. A large gap
      in the stairs, where something or someone has smashed through them, prevents you from going further
      down.
