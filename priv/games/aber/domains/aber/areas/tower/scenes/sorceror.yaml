    sight: >
      You are in a very large and exceedingly magical room, devoted to the pursuit of magic in all its form.
      Flames dance over the walls to light the scene, although they are merely for effect as a permanent
      &+Rfire fountain&* erupts from the center of the room. Gargoyles wink at you from the walls and objects
      move quietly in complex patterns, getting on with the jobs they have been given. There is a door to the
      south, and a doorway leads west. A splendid arched window looks east across the world.
