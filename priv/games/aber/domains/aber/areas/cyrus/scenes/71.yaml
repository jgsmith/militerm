    sight: >
      You are still walking on that trail. You are now standing in front of a small path that continues
      forward to the north, to a small house. You wonder seriously if something is alive there. Who would like
      to live far from a village, in such a creepy place? You will maybe find out soon. You can go east from
      here, toward a turn in the trail.
