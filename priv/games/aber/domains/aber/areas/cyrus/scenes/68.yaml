    sight: >
      You are walking on a small trail north of the village. You can see a mountain ahead of you. The trail is
      surrounded by trees. Birds aren't singing anymore. You can see a bifurcation in the trail. Everything
      has a creepy atmosphere. You can follow the trail further to the north, or turn back.
