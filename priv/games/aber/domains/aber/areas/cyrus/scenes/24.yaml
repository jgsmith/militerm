    short: The Chapel
    sight: >
      The chapel is made of white marble. Cobwebs are lying in every corner of the chapel. There is a huge
      altar. Many benches are placed in order to hear the rituals. A lot of blood had splattered all around
      the place. What beast can do such a thing ?
