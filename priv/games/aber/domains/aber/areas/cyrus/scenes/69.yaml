    short: The trail splits up
    sight: >
      You arrive in front of a mountain. The trail splits west and east. Some trees have been smashed down to
      the west. The ambiance is very creepy. No animals seems to live around here. In fact, except plants,
      nothing is willing to live in a place like this. To the east, a trail looks like it curves toward the
      north. The mountain in front of you at its base has a number of rocks that come to rest. The closest
      footholds feel loose.
