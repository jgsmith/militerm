      When you enter the room, the light is so strong that you have to close your eyes to let them accomodate
      with the light. As you open your eyes, you are gaping in front of the majestic beauty of this place.
      Just in the center of the room, a beautiful sword is standing on its stand. You're wondering who could
      have made this mystic sword. You see a beautiful Christ statue here.
