      north to another mound and east towards a pillar set on the top of the mound. A small grave bears the
      words "Anarchy The Wizard (Out for lunch)" A plaque on the grave reads 'Anarchy The Wizard - slain by
      the Aberystwyth rules --- "If you can't pass your physics you can't have your degree. How can you have
      your degree if you can't pass your physics..."
