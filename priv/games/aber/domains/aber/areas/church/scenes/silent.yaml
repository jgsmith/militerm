    sight: >
      You are standing in a small dark room, beneath the northern barrow. All around you lie the relics of an
      ancient time, crumbling slowly into dust. Everything is dark and creepy, and the sense of malice and
      foreboding makes you jump at the slightest movement in the shadows. The center of the room is a tall
      gravestone bearing the words: "White The Wizard - A man pledged never to make his own coffee."
