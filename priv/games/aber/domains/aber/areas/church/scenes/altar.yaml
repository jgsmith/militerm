    sight: >
      You are standing beside the altar, now barely recognizable, a smashed and aged pile of rotten wood and
      fabrics, hiding mossy stonework beneath. A set of steps lead up to the east, probably to the church
      tower. The main church hall is north, and to the south you can go behind the altar.
