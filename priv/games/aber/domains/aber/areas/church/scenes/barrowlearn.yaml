      Upon entering the small rotten shack, your feet crackle on what sound like nutshells. What you have
      actually stepped on, you do not care to speculate. The one known as Moog hobbles in through the rear of
      the shack with a couple cages of mice. His appendages are disfigured, and his milky white stare leads
      you to believe he knows of your position by some other sense.
