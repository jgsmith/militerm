    short: The Cave
    sight: >
      The cave is dark and stuffy. You turn your light to look at the walls. There are drawings on the walls.
      You can make out two men dressed in suits choking each other. In another picture, a huge white house has
      a rope wrapped around it. The same two men are pulling on each end of the rope. Two podiums with regal
      looking seals stand before you. A sign on the wall reads, &+Y'Next &+Ydebate in 15 minutes.'&* You think
      it would be a good idea to run the other way and miss this most horrid event!
