    sight: >
      You are standing at the place where the heavens meet. Other than the fact that you are standing on a
      cloud, this place seems rather ordinary. To the north, you see a land of mountains and fjords, with a
      sign at the beginning of the road which reads "Valhalla." To the south you see a great and varied land
      with a sign reading "The Happy Hunting Grounds." To the east you see you see a large tent with a firey
      cloud above it.
