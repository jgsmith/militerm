    short: The Garden
    sight: >
      You are in a lush garden. All forms of trees, flowers, and shrubbery surround you. All the creatures of
      the land and air approach you innocently, and the creatures of the water leap out of a near-by lake to
      give you their greetings. You feel peaceful. To the south you see the glimmer of gold.
