    short: Bottom Of The Mine
    sight: >
      You are standing at the bottom of a treacherous ladder which climbs up a narrow vertical shaft. To the
      west you can crawl along a low, heavily shored up tunnel towards a face. Another ladder leads further
      down, but it is rotted and descends only about ten feet before it dissappears into the flooded depths of
      the mine. A hand-carved passage going east glows very dimly. To judge from the moss and slime on the
      wall, this part of the mine is often flooded too.
