    short: Ice Hall
    sight: >
      The hallway here is dripping with slowly flowing icicles and the floor is slick with ice. No matter how
      much you try, you cannot focus on the walls, as if they are actually further away then they appear. To
      the north the hall becomes more normal, and to the south it appears that fire and ice meet each other in
      a flowing artwork.
