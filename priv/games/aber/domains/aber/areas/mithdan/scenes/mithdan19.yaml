    short: Huge Rock
    sight: >
      You stand atop a huge snow-covered rock. The rock itself is over thirty paces long, and it slants
      upwards to the east. The snow makes it difficult to keep from slipping on the slick surface of the
      stone. The path drops away to the north, and thick green forest streches below you.
