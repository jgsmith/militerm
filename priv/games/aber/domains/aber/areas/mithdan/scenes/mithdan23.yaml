      The ledge narrows until you are balancing only on your heels. The ice is slick, and on your next step
      you slip. As you fall, you manage a desperate grab at the ledge, and by some miracle manage to grasp it.
      You dangle from the ledge, unable to scramble back up, for hours, shouting for help. No one is here to
      hear you. Finially your strength gives out, and you plunge hundreds of paces into the deep gorge below
      you.
