    sight: >
      The stone arch streched above you, its massive columns over four paces wide. The columns themselves are
      carved with incredibly intricate runes that seem to gently throb with power. The stone path leads to a
      large clearing to the north, and to the south a stone temple is carved into the mountainside.
