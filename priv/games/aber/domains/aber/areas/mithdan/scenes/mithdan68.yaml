    sight: >
      The street is slightly dusty but well maintained. The cobblestones are neatly laid in geometric
      patterns. To the north is a small temple, to the west are the main village gates and beyond them the
      forest. To the east is a small garden filled with delicately carved stone statues. To the south there is
      nothing but beautifully manicured gardens.
