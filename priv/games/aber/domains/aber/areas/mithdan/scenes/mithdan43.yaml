    sight: >
      The stone in the hall flows and drips as you walk, but is not hot. The floor beneath you rises and falls
      as if it were an ocean, and the walls shift in liquid, flowing patterns. The noise is much stronger
      here, and an ethereal light spills out of the northern chamber. The hall turns a corner to the east.
