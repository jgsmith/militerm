    sight: >
      You stand on the bank of a large crystal clear fish pond. Large tropical fish glitter iridescently in
      the sunlight, occaisionally leaping out of the water to snatch a bug that has strayed too close to the
      surface. The atmosphere is one of calm and serenity, and you could sit and watch the fish for hours.
