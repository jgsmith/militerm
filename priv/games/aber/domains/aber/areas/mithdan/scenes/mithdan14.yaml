    sight: >
      The woods streches off into the distance, filling the area from horizon to horizon. You struggle not to
      lose your direction, but it is impossible to tell if you are still facing the way you began. The forest
      is full of sharp thorns to the south, but to the north, and west it continues uninteruptes. To the east
      there is a thin path covered in snow.
