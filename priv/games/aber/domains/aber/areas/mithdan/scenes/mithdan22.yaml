    sight: >
      The ledge here narrows out further, but thankfully the cliff at your back is lower and you can clamber
      into a small snowy field to the south. The snow is blinding, and you cannot see the bottom of the gorge
      or the end of the field. The ledge continues to the west, but to the east it becomes even narrower.
