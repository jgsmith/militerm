    short: Snowy Field
    sight: >
      The whipping snow makes it impossible to see how big the field is, but it seems to be larger then you
      first thought. Steep, unclimbable cliffs strech above you to the east and west. To the north you can
      dimly make out a thin ledge before a deep gorge, and the whipping snows continue to the south.
