    sight: >
      The path here is slightly more overgrown, and creeping ivy occasionally snakes a tendril across the
      bricks. The ground on either side of you is a beautiful sea of ivy that rolls and sways with each gust
      of wind. The path leads to the north, and to the south you hear the gentle burble of a fountain.
