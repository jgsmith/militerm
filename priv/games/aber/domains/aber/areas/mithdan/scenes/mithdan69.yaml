      The small garden is filled by beautifully carved statues of the elemental gods: Naidrk the water god,
      Thandrain the earth god, and Klendoth the thunder god. In between the statues are immense guardian
      dragon statues, their immense size almost rivaling that of the statues. Clearly among these people
      dragons are held almost at the level of the elemental gods.
