    sight: >
      As you pass beneath the magestic crystal trees, a gust of wind blows through the top branches. There is
      a tremendous crack, and as you gaze up in horror a huge crystal branch crashes through the thinner
      boughs. You run as fast as possible, and throw yourself to the ground. The huge branch misses you, but
      when it strikes the ground it shatters into thousands of needle sharp shards. Almost is slow motion,
      several pieces fly at you, and the last thing you see is the sunlight glinting through them in beautiful
      rainbow patterns.
