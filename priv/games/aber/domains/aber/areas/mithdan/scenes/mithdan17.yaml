    short: Snowy Trail
    sight: >
      The trail is covered with snow that buried the rocks, making travel very difficult. The trail slopes
      upwards steeply, obviously leading up the side of the snow covered mountain that covers the
      south-eastern horizon. Far above you there appears to be some sort of structure, but from here it is
      impossible to tell. The trail slopes down to the east and up to the south.
