    short: Sacred Clearing
    sight: >
      The floor of the clearing is lined with pure white sand, and the air throbs with immense stored magical
      energy. Time seems to pass in a blur: Flowers sprout beneath your feet and die off again in seconds. You
      feel a strange sensation on your legs and when you look down there is a large ivy twining itself around
      your calfs. Paths lead off in all directions. To the south, east, and west thin trails lead through lush
      green forest, and to the north lies a huge forest of living crystal.
