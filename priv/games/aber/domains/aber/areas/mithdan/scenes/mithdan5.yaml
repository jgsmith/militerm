    short: Sandy Clearing
    sight: >
      The floor of the clearing is covered with pure white sand. The edges are well defined, the sand not
      mixing with the dirt of the forest. The clearing is filled with a sense of magic, but there is nothing
      noticable. In the center of the clearing is a firepit, but the edges of the pit have no soot. Thick
      brambles line the north and south of the pit, but the forest on the east and west the forest looks
      thinner.
