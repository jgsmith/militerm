    sight: >
      The thick brambles catch at you clothes as you walk. The trail ahead is covered with them, but you
      perservere. Hidden by the growth, the trail unexpectedly drops away under you. You trip and fall into
      the brambles, unable to stop your rolling. The trail becomes steeper, and the last sight you see is an
      endless sea of brambles and thorns.
