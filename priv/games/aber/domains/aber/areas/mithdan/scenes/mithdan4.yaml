    sight: >
      The woods are thick and confusing. The smell of pine clogs your senses, adding to the effect. The woods
      continue to the west and south. To the east is a sandy clearing. Heavy brambles make passage to the
      north impossible, which is unfortunate because there appears to be something in the distance between the
      trees.
