    sight: >
      It takes you a moment to realize that the red glow here is coming from a round &+Gportal&* on the floor.
      It looks almost as if someone had painted a picture of a white icy fountain bubbling invigorating water.
      Oddly enough, it is so realistic you can feel the cold air and the wet mist coming out of the picture.
