      You continue wandering down the hallway. Nothing much different here, but you are positive you here
      noises behind the door to the south, and coming from the east. The walls are a bit slimy and moldy
      here... yeech, couldn't they hire someone to clean this place? What will the newbies think? Oh well, you
      can continue along the hallway to the east or west.
