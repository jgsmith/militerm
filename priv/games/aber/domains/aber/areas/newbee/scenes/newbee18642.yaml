    sight: >
      Here, the hall opens into a wide room, with a high domed roof. Now that that you have come clear of the
      enclosed passage, you can see that the &+Gstair leads upward to an open air balcony overlooking the
      area. To the south the room continues, and another stair is visible matching the one in front of you.
