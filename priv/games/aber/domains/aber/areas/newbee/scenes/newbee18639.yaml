    sight: >
      As you enter, you light glints of the wall to the east. There appears to be words scrawled on the
      &+Gwall&*, and a crude picture. To the west the room extends beyond the reach of your light, and the
      dark shadows make you paranoid... anything could be hiding there. You are painfully aware of how exposed
      you are without walls around you.
