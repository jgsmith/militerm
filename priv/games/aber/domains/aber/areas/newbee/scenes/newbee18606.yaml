    sight: >
      Hmmm... this is an interesting little room. Ack, and there is an interesting little creature staring at
      you too. He looks a bit surprised at your intrusion. You can leave via the doors north or east, or you
      can stay and annoy him a bit more. There also appears to be some type of well down here also, but it has
      a rather secure grate covering it.
