    sight: >
      This huge hall is another tribute to the skilled stonework of the dwarves, a circular hall with a
      spectacular painted domed roof that seems lost in the shadows high above you. From the walls,
      spectacularly carved gargoyles leer down, attempting to put you off your food. Passages lead north, east
      and west.
