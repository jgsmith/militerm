    sight: >
      Rubble is strewn all about the room. Bones are scattered everywhere and some rusted weapons are stuck in
      the wall. A battle of long time past seems to have taken place in the very place you are standing in.
      You sense great powers were used here in this battle. The passage continues on northward.
