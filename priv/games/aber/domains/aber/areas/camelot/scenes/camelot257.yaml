      You are in Merlin's library. Or at least, the part of it he allows mortals to see. While the number and
      range of books is vast, you quickly ascertain that all of his works of magic must be kept elsewhere. The
      room is well lit by tall windows on the south and west walls, and there are a number of soft chairs
      placed around the room.
