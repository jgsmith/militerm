      In this room, the monsters which have terrorised so many mortals are constructed. The room is filled
      with vats and casks, vials and philters, retorts and alembics. And the remains of a few monsters which
      didn't quite work right and are being recycled (Merlin may kill people, but he is always mindful of the
      ecology).
