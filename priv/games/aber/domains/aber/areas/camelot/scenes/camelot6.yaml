    sight: >
      Although the entire room is filled with wonders, your eyes are drawn again and again to the mighty war
      banner of King Arthur, hanging on the wall behind his throne. The dragon, worked in gold thread, ripples
      as a draft moves the cloth, and it seems to you that it is almost alive, ready to spring down from it's
      perch to defend it's master.
