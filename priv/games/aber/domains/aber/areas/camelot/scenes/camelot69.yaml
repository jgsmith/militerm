      What a place! People are standing in lines just to give their money to other people who are sitting in
      little cages. On the wall is a sign which reads "Camelot Royal Employee Depository for Installments and
      Taxes". You aren't sure what that means, but you'd sure like to go sit in one of those cages for awhile!
