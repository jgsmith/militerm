      Walking through the door, you are struck by the cold air of this room. Some great magic is at work here,
      apparently to better preserve the haunches of beef and venison, the hams, and the other foods stored
      here. Moving towards the exit, you realise that the cold is only intense near the foods. Staying away
      from them, the room is at a normal tempurature.
