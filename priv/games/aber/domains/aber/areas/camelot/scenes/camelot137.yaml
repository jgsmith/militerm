    short: The Bottom Of The Hole
    sight: >
      You fall from the end of the hole into the room below. Luckily, you are not hurt. Looking around you see
      no exits except the one far (too far) above your head. You seem to be rather stuck. But don't worry.
      This is a party room, like Warm Haven. Get your friends to come join you here, and have some fun. At
      least you'll have company...
