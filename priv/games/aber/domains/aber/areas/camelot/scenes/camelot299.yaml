      At first glance, Yeenoghu resembles a human. But his head is that of a hyena, his chest is rather canine
      in form, his feet are paws, and his hands are clawed. He is thin to the point of being skeletal, and his
      only body hair is a putrid yellow crest running to mid-back. His skin is dead gray, and his amber eyes
      glow evilly in the darkness.
