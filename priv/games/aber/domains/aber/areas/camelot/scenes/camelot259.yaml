    sight: >
      Though the floor here is of stone, it has been polished to a high gloss by the passing of countless
      dancing feet. Beside the open dance floor, there are numerous small, private nooks behind the pillars
      for those desiring more private conversation. Across the western wall, a bandstand sits, before the huge
      floor to ceiling windows which let in the light. The stained glass window depicts two scenes, one of a
      tall, lordly man building a castle, the other of a beautiful young woman zapping a troll.
