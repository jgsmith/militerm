    sight: >
      This level of the Keep seems to be devoted to living quarters for guests. Exits North, East, and West
      lead to rooms, while a balcony lies south. Above you lies the entrance to Merlin private apartments. A
      glance up the stairs shows that it is well guarded, and probably not a wise place to intrude.
