    sight: >
      Stalactites and stalagmites hang all around this vast cavern, making it look like one enormous maw of a
      hideous beast. You can hear dripping around you, but the strange hollow echo of this place makes it
      impossible to tell where. Occasionally fierce winds gust in and make an eerie sound as it bounces off
      the warped walls of the cavern. The room is dark except for a little torchlight coming from the east
      from what appears to be a gigantic tunnel.
