    sight: >
      You are within a luxurious foyer. The only illumination is from a platinum chandalier hanging in the
      black marble ceiling above. Its dim flickering light makes shadows dance off of the nearby black marble
      pillars. To the north and south you can see two very large rooms filled with gold and platinum! East is,
      through a doorway is a another large room, not quite as tantalizing as the ones to the north and east.
