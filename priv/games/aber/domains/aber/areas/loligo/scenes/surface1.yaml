    sight: >
      You are standing on the shore of a vast ocean. Beneath your feet the ground is merely a vast expanse of
      congealed lava which extends right up to the water's edge. To the west the wasteland continues for some
      way before meeting the foot of the volcano which created this bleak landscape.
