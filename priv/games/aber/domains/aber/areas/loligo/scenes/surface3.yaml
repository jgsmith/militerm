    sight: >
      You are far out from the shore, drifting in the open ocean. On the western horizon the peak of a volcano
      looms above the waves, but the shore itself is hidden. The water here is deep, but to the east it
      becomes even deeper as the continental shelf drops away to the vast ocean plain.
