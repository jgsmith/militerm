    sight: >
      Is similar in design and function to the Pandion Chapterhouses. Basically you stand in a large keep
      which is the headquarters for the Pandion knights. Various knight training devices are situated
      thoughout the room, and bloodstains on the ground remind you what it is that knights actually do. The
      only exits you can see are the main gates to the north, and a small staircase leading up.
