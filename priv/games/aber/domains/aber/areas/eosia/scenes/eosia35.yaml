    sight: >
      This is the city of Zemoch, in the Empire of Zemoch. It is here that the evil god Azash has made his
      home. You can feel the evil in the air and you cringe at the feeling. The builings are all gray and
      black, and the sky above you is muted in gray clouds. To the north is the palace, to the east, a dark
      looking temple, and to the south, a strange, yet familiar looking temple.
