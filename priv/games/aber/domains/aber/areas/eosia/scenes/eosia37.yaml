    short: The Imperial Throne Room
    sight: >
      This is the throne room for the Empire of Zemoch. For an Imperial Throne room, this room is quite dull.
      The room is made out of gray stone, and some form of mold grows abundently upon them. Before you, a huge
      stone dias marks the place where the Emperor used to sit, when he still cared enough to rule his empire.
      You imagine that once this whole city used to be filled with color and activity, but now, it is filled
      with only decay.
