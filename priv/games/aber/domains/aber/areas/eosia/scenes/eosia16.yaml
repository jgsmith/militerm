      This room looks like it has been used a lot recently. This is where the Royal governing council of
      Elenia has been meeting while Ehlana has been ill. Papers, maps, and books lay strewn about in a
      disarray, almost as if someone had been searching for something. Glancing at one of documents you are
      startled to discover that Primate Annias, a churchman, was responsible for the poisoning of Ehlana. It
      seems Annias wants to become Archprelate of the Church, and poisoned Ehlana to gain access to the
      Elenian treasury. Sephrenia and a handful of Pandion Knights sealed Ehlana in crystal in the hopes of
      keeping her alive until a cure could be found to save her. There is no sign as to where any of them have
      gone.
