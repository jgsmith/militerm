    sight: >
      This is Chyrellos, capital city of the Elene Church. Your eyes are filled with wonder at all the sights
      to see in this maginificent city. People move about you on their errands, each one on a mission. To the
      east stands the Basilica, the highest church in the Elene faith. It is there that the Archprelate
      reigns.
