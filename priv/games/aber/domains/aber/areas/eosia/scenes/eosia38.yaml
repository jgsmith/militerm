      Or so it seems. Everything about this place would make you think that you were actually in the Temple of
      Paradise, except for the fact that the familiar pit is gone. Why this room should exist is a mystery,
      and given the fact the Emperor Zemoch has gone insane, this room could serve any purpose. In any case,
      it has provided you some shelter from the dreary air outside. The only exit is back to the north.
