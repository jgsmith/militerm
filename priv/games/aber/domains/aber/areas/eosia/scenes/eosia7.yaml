      You stand in the local chapter of the Thieves' Guild. Here is where all of the local thieves, from
      cut-throat thieves to small pick pockets, meet and discuss business. You can just barely make out sounds
      from the Inn upstairs coming through the ceiling. Looking about you see many of the items 'obtained' by
      the thieves during thier normal working hours. A banner hangs on the far wall stating 'Congratulations
      Seamas and Traveller on your 100+ thefts.' The only exit is up.
