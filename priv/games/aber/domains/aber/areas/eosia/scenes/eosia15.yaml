      From this room Queen Ehlana used to rule the whole Kingdom of Elenia. Now, it lies empty, sealed by
      order of Primate Annias. The air is cold and stale, and you suspect no one has been in this room for
      months. A sound catches your attention, but when you look, there is nothing there. A sadness fills the
      room, and in the silence, you can just make out a heartbeat. A chill fills you to the bone when you
      realize that what you hear is the heartbeat of Queen Ehlana, encased in crystal in the front of the
      room.
