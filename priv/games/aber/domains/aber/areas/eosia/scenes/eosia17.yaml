    short: The Royal Crypt
    sight: >
      This is were the Kings and Queens of Elenia have been buried over the centuries. The crypt extends back
      into the darkness. The room is cold and dank, and you would rather not be down here, given the choice.
      Many coffins stand along the walls, each with the name of its occupant on the cover. Perhaps if you stay
      long enough, maybe you will see the ghost of the last king to sit on the throne of Elenia.
