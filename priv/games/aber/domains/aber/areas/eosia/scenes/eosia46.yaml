      You stand in a vast room at the center of the maze. Before you is the altar to Azash, the most evil of
      the Elder Gods of Styricum. The room is nothing but pure evil. Sounds of horror echo inside your head as
      the spirit of Azash attempts to take your soul. Even the most powerful of knights would have a hard time
      resisting the call to darkness that fills this room. A green portal flickers to the north, just past the
      altar.
