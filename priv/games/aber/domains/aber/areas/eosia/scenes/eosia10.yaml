      You are standing in the northern part of the main square of Cimmura. Before you stands the gates to the
      royal castle, to the east, lays the local chapterhouse of the Pandion knights, the Elenian branch of the
      Church Knights. Pennants fly all about preparing for the coronation of the Prince Reagant as King.
