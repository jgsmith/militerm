    sight: >
      This is one of the more unsavory places to visit in Cimmura. Known for its fights, and wild times, this
      establishment has been on the royal condemnation list for years. However, thanks to the local Thieves,
      it has maintained its own existance. The Inn is closed right now, but perhaps if you came back later?
