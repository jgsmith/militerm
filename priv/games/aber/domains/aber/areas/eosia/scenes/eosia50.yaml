    sight: >
      You stand in one of the messiest room's you have ever seen. This is the home of the insane troll,
      Ghwerig. After having locked himself away with the Bhelliom, Ghwerig went utterly insane. Rags, various
      pieces of metal and other nick-nacks lay strewn about on the floor. You feel very claustrophobic in
      here. The ceiling appears as if it wants to collapse!
