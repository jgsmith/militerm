    sight: >
      You stand on the shore of Elenia facing south looking out over the waters of the Inner Sea. Water laps
      the ground at your feet and the smell of salt water fills the air. You can make out the sounds of
      seagulls flying high overhead. A gentle breeze is blowing in off the water, carrying with it, the smells
      of the ocean.
