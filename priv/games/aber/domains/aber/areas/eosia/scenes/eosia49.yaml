    sight: >
      You are at the base of one of the tallest mountains you have ever seen. Just avove the clouds, you think
      you can make out the snow covered peak. The air about you is calm in the cold air. Pine trees abound and
      you can smell their crisp aroma. A path leads back to the south.
