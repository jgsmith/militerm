    sight: >
      This is the main square of Cimmura. From this point roads head off in every direction into different
      parts of the city. To the north lies the Royal Castle. From here you can see the flags of Elenia
      fluttering in the breeze. People pass you all around hurrying to get to their destinations. If you're
      not careful, you could get run over by one of the horses.
