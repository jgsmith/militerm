      After crossing a small channel, you have arrived on the shores of the kingdom of Thalesia. It is here
      that the trolls have been rumored to live. To the north and west mountains rise up out of the ground to
      meet the sky. To the south, just past the channel, you can makes out the shoreline of the kingdom of
      Deira.
