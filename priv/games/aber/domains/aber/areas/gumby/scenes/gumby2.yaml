    short: A Clearing in the Forest
    sight: >
      You're standing in a clearing in the middle of the forest with the only light coming from the full moon
      above. A stiff, cold breeze swirls around you. You blink, and a figure emerges from the shadows. He
      pulls his hood down to reveal his face. Even though you know that you've never seen him before, you
      instantly feel at ease in the stranger's presence. His hair is blown askew and his soft green eyes
      crinkle as he smiles down on you. He abruptly drops to one knee, takes your hands in his, and rests his
      forehead on the backs of them. Then, he slowly lifts his face to gaze at you with his slight smile
      again, raising your hand to his lips to kiss it. You shiver, and he rises to remove his cloak and places
      it on your shoulders. However, the instant his cloak leaves his hands, he begins to disappear. You
      notice the longing smile directed at you as his lips say something you cannot hear. Then, he vanishes,
      leaving a white rose and a note in his place. You pick both objects up, unfold the note, and begin to
      read. Once you finish, it begins to change into the shape of a heart before it, too, vanishes. The
      breeze picks up one last time as you hear a voice whisper into your ears, "Je vous aime beaucoup
      toujours, ma cherie." Then, all is silence, leaving you with the cloak and the rose.
