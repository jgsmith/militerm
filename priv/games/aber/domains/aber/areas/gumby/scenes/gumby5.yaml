      As you step into the room, your feet seem to be swallowed by the thousands of petals from various
      flowers covering the floor. A large bed lined with black silk sheets and covered with pillows, dominates
      the west end of the room. A black marble fireplace makes up the north wall and is occupied by a warm
      fire. Soft melodies seem to emanate from within the walls and float about the room. To the east is a
      sliding glass door that leads to the balcony.
