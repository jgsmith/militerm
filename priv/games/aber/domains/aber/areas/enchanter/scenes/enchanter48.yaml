      You're at the top of the tower, standing in the doorway of a really noisy room. Giant axe blades are
      swinging back and forth across the room. If you were nimble enough, you could probably dodge them and
      get through, except there are also enormous saw-blades spinning around the room. And if this weren't
      enough, a huge hammer crashes down on the floor every three or four seconds. It probably wouldn't be a
      good idea to go through there. On the other side of the mess, you can see some sort of control room. You
      can barely see a parchment scroll just inside the control room. It must be important!
