    sight: >
      You've come to another junction in the hall. East of here, you can see a landing and a dark staircase
      going both up and down. You presume it's the fifth, dark, smoky tower. To the west is a large courtyard,
      with some sort of temple in it. The chanting sound seems to be coming from there. The hall continues to
      the south.
