      You look around in wonder at the inside of the hovel. Shelves of strange and wonderful potions line the
      walls. There is a bench in the middle of the room, covered with smoking vials of all types. An ancient
      crone stands behind the bench, stirring a boiling pot. She hears you enter, and looks up.
