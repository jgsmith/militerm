    sight: >
      Really, unless Krill's invited you here, you shouldn't be here. The walls are painted with blood, and
      various implements of torture hang from the walls. No different from any other place here in the castle.
      But of note in this room is the bar. At first glance, it seems to be a regular well stocked bar, with
      everything from cinnamon schnapps to a bottle of tequila with the worm. You sit on a stool, and a
      ghostly bartender materializes before you (a la Shining) to take your order. Before you can mouth your
      wish, he nods, and turns his back to you, and begins mixing the marguerita you wanted. The bartender
      turns around, and sets the glass on the bar before you. You begin conversing with him, sipping your
      marguerita, and reminiscing about the days before Krill invaded the castle and murdered the local
      populace. More apparitions begin appearing around you, and you order another drink, and then another.
      Soon, you've forgotten who you are, and all you know is what these simple villagers knew when Krill came
      and changed their world. Before long, you pass out, slumped over on the bar. When you wake up, you are
      alone, shivering, afraid, and determined to undo the damage that Krill did here.
