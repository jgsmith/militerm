      The castle's kitchen used to be a busy, noisy place. It's quiet now... but the room clearly has a story
      to tell. Shortly after Krill came to this land, he enslaved the people of the castle. Some of them, he
      set to work at dreary tasks, and others he simply tortured to death for the fun of it. He transformed
      the kitchen to a torture chamber, and clearly spent many hours here watching the bodies twitch. They
      aren't twitching now. You turn your head in disgust.
