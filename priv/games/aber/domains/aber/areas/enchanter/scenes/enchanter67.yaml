    sight: >
      You're an a room with not-quite-opaque cream colored walls. Behind the walls you can see slow, fluid
      movement, as if the rock was alive. The room shows signs of an evil presence that was trapped here for
      millenia. You can still feel it's black residue brushing against your soul. You can't wait to get out of
      here.
