    sight: >
      Other than the large oak door at the north end of the room, this room is bare. But what a door it is --
      On the center of it is some sort of ornament. It looks like a wild boar's head.. with snakes for hair,
      and razor-sharp knives for teeth. It seems to be slobbering acid.
