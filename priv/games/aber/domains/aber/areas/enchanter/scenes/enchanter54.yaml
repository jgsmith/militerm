      You yawn in boredom as you walk through this art gallery. As art goes, this is definitely nothing to
      write home about. Almost all of the paintings are still-life fruit bowls. One, however, catches your
      eye... it's a painting of the castle as it was before Krill took it over. It's hard to believe the
      castle was once beautiful. You notice that in the &+Cpainting&*, there are only four towers. It seems
      that Krill added his fifth tower himself. You shiver in fear as you think about that inky black tower.
      The painting seems to be glowing faintly.
