    sight: >
      You've wandered into the Temple of Krill. All of Krill's loyal followers are gathered here. The floor is
      sticky with sacrificed blood here. None of the little hairy men have taken any notice of you... they're
      all concentrating on the giant altar in the center of the room. At the top, there's a statue of Krill.
