    sight: >
      Finally, you collapse in exhaustion at the peak of Signal Mountain, or Lonely Mountain as it is also
      called. The air is chilly, but amazingly fresh up here. You look around in awe... Far off to the west,
      you can barely make out the Temple of Paradise, and a small village. But your heart freezes in fear as
      you look to the east. Rising out of the forest is a black castle, with five towers. One of the towers is
      larger than the others, and inky black smoke rises from the top. From here, you can see that the road
      you were on encircles the mountain. There is a small village to the south.
