      You are in a vast greenhouse whose roof is two hundred feet above you. You stare in awe as you gaze upon
      a whole host of plantlife taken from every period of Earth's history. To the left are tree ferns,
      towering thirty feet high, spreading their feathery fronds for many yards in all directions. To the
      right are horsetails as big as trees with great woody trunks that bear no resemblance to the little
      grass-like weeds that are so common around wet ground in the countryside. And in front of you, towering
      towards the roof, are several huge lycopods, like trees in size and shape but related to mosses and
      their kin. A number of less massive exhibits are lined up against the glass walls of the greenhouse, and
      some shrubs and monkey puzzle saplings grow here and there in the shade of the lycopods.
