    sight: >
      A long jetty made of jumbled rock pokes out into the sea, a lighthouse perched at its end. Fisherman sit
      along the sides of the jetty, hoping to catch a little luck and maybe some dinner along with it. There
      does not appear any way to get west onto the jetty's walkway from the sea.
