    sight: >
      The wind has picked up a bit and has caused the sea to begin to churn a bit, the water bobbing and
      jumping rapidly. Every now and again a small fish can be seen jumping up from the wake, searching for
      food on the surface. Bal Harbor's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle the city
      itself can be seen.
