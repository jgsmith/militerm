    sight: >
      A long rock jetty with a lighhouse at its end runs out into the sea. It appears that climbing the rocks
      to the jetty's walkway might be hazardous to one's health, so another way up must be found. The shore
      lies just south of here, but that too is covered in rock and scree and appears unclimbable.
