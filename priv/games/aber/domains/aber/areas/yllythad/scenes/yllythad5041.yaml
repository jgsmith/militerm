    sight: >
      The water rises and falls with such force that it seems the world must be shaking on its foundations.
      The water splashes and crashes against itself, foam and froth all over the surface of the sea. The sea
      is dashed again and again against the rock face of a cliff on the south side. To the west a huge opening
      in the cliff can be seen, opening into a large bay.
