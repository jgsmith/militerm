    short: A Gentle Breeze
    sight: >
      A calming, fresh breeze blows in bring the fresh scent of the open sea and the tang of salt with it. The
      sea appears to be cooperating with travel, only gentle swells at this point. A sandy beach lies just to
      the south, running along the length of a steep cliff face.
