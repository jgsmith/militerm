    short: Calm Waters
    sight: >
      The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling of peace and comfort. They
      are not the dead calm that always is associated with dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll
      that promises a good day at sea. Bal Harbor's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this
      angle the city itself can be seen. You have come upon a number of floating docks to tie your boat up.
      Once you disembark, you can ascend the ladder up to the main dock.
