      The wind has picked up a bit and has caused the sea to begin to churn a bit, the water bobbing and
      jumping rapidly. Every now and again a small fish can be seen jumping up from the wake, searching for
      food on the surface. A rock littered shore lies to the south, so jumbled and covered in rock as to be
      unpassable.
