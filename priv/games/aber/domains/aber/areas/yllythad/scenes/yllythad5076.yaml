    short: A Gentle Breeze
    sight: >
      The fresh breeze that blows past is a calm, gentle one that can only be called dreamy. A sailor in these
      winds would gladly lie on the deck of his ship with his tankard of grog beside and happily think of the
      whores he has known, never once having the desire or need to get up and work.
