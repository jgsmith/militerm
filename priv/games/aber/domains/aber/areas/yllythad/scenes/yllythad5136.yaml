    short: A Strong Current
    sight: >
      This area of the sea is carried along by a strong undercurrent which moves the water in its own
      direction, regardless of the wind or weather topside. The beach area to the south has begun to get
      covered in rocks, making it unsafe to attempt travel onto land. It looks a bit more safe to the east.
