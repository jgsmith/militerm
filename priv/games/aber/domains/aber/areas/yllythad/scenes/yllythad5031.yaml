      The sea has turned to calm that is almost unsettling. Any sailor would bow their head and say a quick
      prayer to the Sea God at this time to pray for a wind of some sort. Looking in all directions, the sea
      is still and quiet. Bal Harbor's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle the city
      itself can be seen.
