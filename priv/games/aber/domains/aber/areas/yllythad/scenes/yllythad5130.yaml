    sight: >
      A tall lighthouse stands at the end of a rock jetty which juts out into the sea. The rocks which form
      the jetty look exceptionally large and sharp - sharp enough, in fact, that they do not warrant an
      attempt at climbing. It seems that another way to the lighthouse will have to be found.
