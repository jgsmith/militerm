    short: A Strong Current
    sight: >
      This area of the sea is carried along by a strong undercurrent which moves the water in its own
      direction, regardless of the wind or weather topside. The sea is dashed again and again against the rock
      face of a cliff on the south side. To the west a huge opening in the cliff can be seen, opening into a
      large bay.
