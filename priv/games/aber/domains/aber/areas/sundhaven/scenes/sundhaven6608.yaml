    sight: >
      The traffic of foreigners and local citizens is heavy here, the ground is trodden down and the scents of
      animals, smoke and exotic perfumes hangs in the air. The cliffs and the northern gate of the town lie
      north of here, the lane paralleling the cliffs runs east and west, and the entrance to the temple is
      southwards.
