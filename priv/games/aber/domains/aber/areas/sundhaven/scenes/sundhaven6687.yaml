    short: A dwelling among strange rock formations
    sight: >
      You stand in a narrow dwelling among the bluff-scattered homes of Sundhaven. Out of rectangular-etched
      windows you can make out odd Stonehenge-style formations of stone, giving the place an eerie feel. It
      could make an excellent home, with enough gold to pay the price of the lot.
