    sight: >
      The fog engulfs you, making you step carefully as you barely can see a couple steps ahead of you. You
      hear the gentle breaking of waves below and hope you don't confuse that with stepping on loose rocks.
      The cliff continues a good distance downward, while it seems more inviting to go upward.
