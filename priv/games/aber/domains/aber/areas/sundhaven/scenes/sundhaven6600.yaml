    short: The sunken temple courtyard
    sight: >
      The pale light from the open sky pours always into this unsheltered courtyard, together with the amber
      glow of standing torches. Many citizens of the town of Sundhaven find it their pleasure to lounge here.
      The dark marble temple rises like a shadow to the north, the vivid colors of roses eastwards, and the
      library lies to the west. There is a stone arch to the south.
