    sight: >
      You have entered the infamous Nightbreak Cafe, home by night to those who secret themselves away in
      hideouts by day. The place is well-known to be run by the local assassins guild, and it is common to
      witness conversations here spoken in whispers as deals are cut and bounties arranged. The &+Crules&* of
      conduct are etched on the back wall.
