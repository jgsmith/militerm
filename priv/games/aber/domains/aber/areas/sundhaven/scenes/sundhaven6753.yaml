    sight: >
      The walls of the sanctuary of those of a priestly bent are indefinite, seemingly rounded and blurred by
      a muted pale light that seems to come from nowhere. It is perhaps a product of the combined faiths of
      those who live here.. dark, alabaster, and every shade in between. All beliefs are accepted here,
      provided they are not discussed too often, lest blood should be spilt. There are several bookshelves of
      varying religious works, an altar without ornament, and numerous cots for clerics to take their rest in.
