    sight: >
      Artifacts and relics from a time before the known world are encased and illumined in airless, black
      glass cabinets, their twinkling golden and silver chasings catching your eye with mocking immortality.
      Urns of demon ash line polished amberwood shelves, and a small, simple altar edged in ivory stands
      against the north wall. This is the sanctum of the ministry. Those of a pious bent would do well to
      begin studies here.
