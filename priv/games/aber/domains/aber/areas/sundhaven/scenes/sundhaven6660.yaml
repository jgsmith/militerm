    sight: >
      This high point on the northern edge of Sundhaven boasts quite a view. When fog is not seen rolling
      about the balcony's railing, one can see the graveyard near the foot of the cliff to the north, and
      beyond it, the pearl blue sea, clothing the far horizon. The mages have made this a favored place for
      recreational studies.
