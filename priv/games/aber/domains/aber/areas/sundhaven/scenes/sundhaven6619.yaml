    short: At the gallows
    sight: >
      In the shade of old gnarl-limbed elder trees stands the bane of all thieves and murderers, the platform
      of the gallows. The dark sand of the road shows none of the blood that has been shed here, but the
      legends of the dead live on in tales and nightmares. The executions still take place at irregular
      intervals, to the joy of hidden enemies and law-abiding citizens. You note there is plenty of room for
      spectators. Besides the east-west road, a stone arch stands to the north, and a well-travelled path
      leads southwards.
