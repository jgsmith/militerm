    short: The House of Witches
    sight: >
      Dangling mirrors reflect your face a thousand times from the walls and ceiling of this supply house of
      witchcraft. Ingredients for the hexes of hags and the poisons of roguish assassins bubble and float in
      jars crowded onto shelves, and tinkling against each other from strings around the stone doorway. A
      voodoo doll pinned to one wall seems to be eyeing you. Let's hope you are not already earmarked for
      demise by someone.
