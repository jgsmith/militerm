    sight: >
      You wade ankle-deep into the murky waters of a black-bottom pool. It appears this pool was once a nice
      pleasure bath for the priests and their guests, but has fallen into decay from recent lack of use. Who
      knows what creatures make their home beneath the dark surface.
