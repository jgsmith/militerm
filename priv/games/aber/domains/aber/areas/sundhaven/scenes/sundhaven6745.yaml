    sight: >
      The darkness of a steep stairwell encloses you. The dripping and oozing sounds of slime creeping down
      the walls is barely detectable beneath the sounds of your own breathing. There seems to be tracks of
      footfalls in the slime coating the steps.. evidently this serves as a secret passageway, regularly used,
      for some individuals of a shady nature.
