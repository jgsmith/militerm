    sight: >
      A few gnarled, wind-tortured trees spread their meager limbs in hunched eastward arcs. There is little
      that is extraordinary about this place. It is deserted, it is lonely, yet a particularly green bluff
      forms a plateau just above you. It calls to you in an eerie way, yet emits a chaotic aura that might be
      best left alone.
