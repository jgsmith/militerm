    sight: >
      You have come to a crossroads of sorts. A park lies to the north, from which a pleasant scent is
      drifting, and the road continues, narrowing, to the west towards the homes of the residents. Eastwards
      lies shops and the northern gate; a shaded lane travels to the south.
