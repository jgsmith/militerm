    short: A black sand road
    sight: >
      Black sand has been hauled up the steep cliffs from the beaches to reduce the unpleasant affects of
      copious mud during the frequent rains and heavy fogs of the region. The road is so heavily travelled it
      has almost been packed down into a hard surface.
