    short: A dark spiral staircase
    sight: >
      The immobile stone faces of gargoyles regard you with cold stares from the walls of the darkened
      stairwell. At each turn in the spiral steps a more mangled face than the last confronts you, drawing
      closer to the laboratory above. What is the sculptor implying about the study of magic?
