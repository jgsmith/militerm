    sight: >
      The black sand of the road absorbs heat and feels pleasant to those without coverings on their feet,
      attracting all sorts of loafers and siteseers who come on days off to relax and watch the festivities at
      the gallows. A &+Rbloody trail&* leads into a building to the south.
