    sight: >
      The lonely hilltop is blanketed in a strange, rich green grass-cover, and the only sound is that of the
      wind whistling over the moors. A haunting, otherworldly presence has made this bluff its home, casting
      what malevolence it yet can on the mortal world, and giving the bluff its name.
