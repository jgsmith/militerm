    sight: >
      The wind picks up and blows sharply at your hair and garb as the town falls behind and the world opens
      out before you. You are standing atop a highland cliff, lined with mosses, lichen and purple heather,
      and looking out over a foggy wetland. The graveyard for the dead of Sundhaven lies near the foot of the
      cliffs, and in the far distance you can make out the blue line of the sea closing the horizon.
