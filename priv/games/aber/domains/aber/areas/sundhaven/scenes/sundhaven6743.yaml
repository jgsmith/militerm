    sight: >
      You slip down into the hideaway. A pleasant room encloses you, a windowless dugout hidden from the
      lawful population and furnished with kick-back chairs and half-full bottles of wine. No bounty hunter
      could find a lounging thief here, sheltered away from the executioners of town. No hunter, that is,
      except a rogue like yourself.
