    sight: >
      The hideout of rogues is surprisingly comfortable. Although no refuge from the blood and risk of their
      everyday existence, it is nevertheless a haven in which bounties can be split and repose taken by a warm
      fireplace hung with guild daggers, skillfully tapered and too hot from the flames to steal. A bar sunken
      into the far stone wall assists your dexterity.. so it is said..and bunks are layer the area to the
      east, hung with stolen tapestries and sheets.
