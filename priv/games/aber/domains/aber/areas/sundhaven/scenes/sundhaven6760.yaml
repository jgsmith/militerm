      You stand just outside the eastern gate of the town of Sundhaven. Fresh bread and cool drink await those
      within who are willing to pay for the service, and about the city, other willing merchants may also be
      found in abundance. Eastwards the land stretches in unmarred wilderness to the far horizon, and to the
      southeast you think you can catch glimpses of the thatched roofs of yet another village, this one
      smaller and more humble. A trail south along the cobblestone wall seems to head in that direction.
