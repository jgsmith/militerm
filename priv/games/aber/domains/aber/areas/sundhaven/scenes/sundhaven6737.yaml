    short: A dark passageway
    sight: >
      You slip cautiously along the passage. The wall is dotted with large holes, roomy enough for a large
      rat.. or something.. to pass through with ease, and are not just down by the ground but up near the
      ceiling. A fetid stench rolls over you from within the holes. The passage continues south and east into
      black.
