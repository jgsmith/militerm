      **BOOM!** When your vision returns to normal, you find yourself surrounded by narrow black lab tables
      cluttered with a chaotic mess of bubbling vials, shattered beakers, and miscellaneous spell components.
      The latest experiment in familiars, a leathery-skinned fork-tailed creature, hops knavishly from
      shoulder to shoulder among the mages at work here. If you need practice in the magic arts, this would be
      a good place to start.
