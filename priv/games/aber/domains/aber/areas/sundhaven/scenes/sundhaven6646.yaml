      A circular stone is whirring in a fast spin at the far wall, as the weaponsmaster of Sundhaven
      continually sharpens his wares, and re-hangs them to display on the stone and mortar walls. A single
      window admits virtually no light, so filled with the webs and dust of neglect is it.. obviously the
      shopowner prefers to seclude himself to the obsessive labors of his work. You wonder if he ever makes
      anything new, so fanatical he is about sharpening and re-sharpening the old.
