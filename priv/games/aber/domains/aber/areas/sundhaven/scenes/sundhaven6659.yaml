    sight: >
      You make your way thru the fog, stepping carefully as you barely can see a couple steps ahead of you.
      You hear the gentle breaking of waves below and hope you don't confuse that with stepping on loose
      rocks. The cliff continues a good distance downward, while maybe you don't have much left to go upward.
