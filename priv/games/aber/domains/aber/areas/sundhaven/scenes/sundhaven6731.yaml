    sight: >
      Dark brambles hung with dully shining berries form condensed hedges, growing in lines and stretching
      their thorny tendrils across your path. The limbs trail low, heavy with fruit in temperate climate. High
      stone walls protect this precious bower from the destructive noise and thoughts of ordinary humans.
