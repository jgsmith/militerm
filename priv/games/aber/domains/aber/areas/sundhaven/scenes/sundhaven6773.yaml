      Shadows seem to creep within the shadows already existing, clashing and clambering over one another
      before the approach of your footfalls, yet everything seems to indicate to you that this is not the sort
      of fun fairy-tale niche your mother liked to tell tales about by the fireside of your ancient home. Do
      you continue, or turn back? Sometimes shadows may form a bluff of great danger in the recesses of your
      imagination.
