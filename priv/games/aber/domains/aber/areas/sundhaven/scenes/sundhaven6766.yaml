    sight: >
      The slender trail winds its way north-south through bending trees laiden with spanish moss. (Except this
      was before Spain.) It comes to an end before the bubbling ebbs of a tiny stream, pouring gently forth
      from a hole in the rock on which you are poised, and flows southward.
