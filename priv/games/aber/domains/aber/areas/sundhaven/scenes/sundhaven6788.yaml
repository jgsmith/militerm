    short: The end of the dock
    sight: >
      You've walked up toward the edge of the dock where fisherman cast their lines or climb down into their
      boats to go further out. Very few people use this dock to sail to other lands perfering to take the long
      way by land due to the numbers of people lost at sea by unpleasant encounters with sea creatures. A ramp
      runs westward for servicing larger boats.
