    sight: >
      The town wall to the north and stone building to the east are climbing with purple-flowering wisteria
      vine, forming in leafy clumps at the bottoms. The park is a quiet, relaxing place, with the exception of
      the occasional explosion coming from a pale tower rising to the northwest, accompanied by a brilliant
      flash of light.
