      You narrowly avoid the guillotine-style slash of a rusted axe as you pass through the doorway of the
      town post office. It seems some sort of riot is underway in here - what would be a strike if this wasn't
      before unions - among the numerous disgruntled postal workers conglomerated. Shining silver letter-
      openers flash in the light as they heedlessly try to backstab anyone in sight. It's a droll scene. You
      decide it prudent to mail your wares and be on your way. There is a &+Csign&* posted on the north wall.
