    short: The southern path
    sight: >
      The soft mud of the path loosens and parts as it meets your heels, pulling you in slightly with each
      step. A rotten stench is filtering in from the west, repelling you in another direction automatically
      such that it takes a great conscious effort for you to turn that way. The path heads north into the
      town's mainstream, and south closer to the wildlands beyond it.
