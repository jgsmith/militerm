    sight: >
      Gently curving sigils have been worked into the ancient, weathered stone of the tower of the local
      wizards, winding towards the ceiling in a sloping spiral. A stairwell has its foot at the north wall,
      rickety but presumably stable enough to support you. A dim violet faerie glow illuminates the room.
