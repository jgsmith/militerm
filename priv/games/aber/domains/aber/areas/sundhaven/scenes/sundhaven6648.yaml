      You have entered a rowdy tavern, noticeably different from the intellectual bounty hunting atmosphere of
      the Nightbreak Cafe. Your feet are hard put to find a purchase on the slippery floor of spilled ale and
      cracked, sodden wood. This is the meeting place of those of a fighting bent, accordingly the blood from
      last night's brawls has barely dried on the walls before tonight's is shed, be wary.
