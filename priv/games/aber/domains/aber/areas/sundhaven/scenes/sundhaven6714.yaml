    short: A red stone dwelling
    sight: >
      You stand in a quiet dwelling of mortar and rose-colored stone. Occupied now by only a few spiders, it
      looks like it could be a comfortable place to live, with a little work. And gold, of course. Perhaps it
      may be bought from one of the gods.
