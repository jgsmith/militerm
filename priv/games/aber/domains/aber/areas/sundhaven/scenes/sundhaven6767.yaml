    sight: >
      A quietly flowing stream drifts down a slim riverbed, leading south from a small hole in the rock to the
      north. The water is clear and pure, and seems entirely empty of creatures.. It may be true this stream
      was taxed by heavy fishing long ago that long since cleaned it of all life.
