    short: Sundhaven Hospital
    sight: >
      This small hospital doesn't seem adequate for a city of this size. Numerous warriors, gladiators, and
      amazons are lined up along a wall with broken, bleeding bodies waiting their turn to be patched up. You
      should hope that when you need medical attention you won't have to wait too long. The northern doors
      lead back out to the black sandy street.
