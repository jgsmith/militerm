    short: A hall in the Assassins Guild
    sight: >
      You stand in a wide, dark hallway of the Assassins Guild. On the ceiling spreads a gigantic mural of the
      black serpentlike naga, a model of stealth and intelligence, in muted blue and black. An elegant table
      stands against the wall, laid with a simple black cloth and a few daggers.
