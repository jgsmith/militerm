    short: A short mossy cliff
    sight: >
      A four foot grey stone cliff, matted with clumps of green moss and overhung with tall bending trees, is
      easily scaled by handy footholds in the rock. The place looks well-travelled by some hardy population of
      small-footed creatures. One path continues in a north-south vein over the cliff, another breaks off and
      leads east.
