      You have arrived along the northern shores of Sundhaven. From here you have difficulty seeing the top of
      the cliffs due to the fog hanging in this area. The shoreline is too rocky for you to make landfall, but
      there seems to be something jutting out into the water in the west. To the north is the open sea.
