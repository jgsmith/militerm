    sight: >
      The wind blows your hair from your face as you stand atop a small bluff, beautiful in its blossom colors
      of lavender and mist-grey flowers. The abodes of the residents of Sundhaven litter the surroundings,
      nestled among the rocks and clinging to the precarious cliff edge.
