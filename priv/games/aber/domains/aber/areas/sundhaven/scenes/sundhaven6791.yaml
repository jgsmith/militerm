    sight: >
      Your boat has reached the sides of the docks allowing you to disembark your vessel or embark into the
      high seas. The fog makes visibility low, with no fog horns or lighthouses to help you find your way. The
      open seas expand northward, while you can dock with another section of the piers to the west.
