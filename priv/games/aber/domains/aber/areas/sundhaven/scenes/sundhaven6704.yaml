    short: A small haunted grove
    sight: >
      With the exception of the inexplicable darkness permeating this grove, there is little way to explain
      the odd feeling of foreboding about this place. No birds sing, no rat scurries in the open, the leaves
      rustle barely enough to break the silence. Yet an odd presence makes itself felt.
