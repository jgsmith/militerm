    sight: >
      Quaint cobblestone and mortar walls enclose you, creating a quiet atmosphere. This is home now to only a
      few small mice, but it appears that it could be a comforatble place to live, with a little work. And
      enough gold. Perhaps it may be bought from one of the gods of the realm.
