    sight: >
      You stand outside the southern gate of the town of Sundhaven. The walls are high enough to keep the town
      secure, and ringed with tendrils of lush green ivy. The busy murmur of citylife can be heard from
      beyond. Southwards, the cobblestone road crosses a large meadow before disappearing into a line of dark
      woods.
