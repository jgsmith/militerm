    short: Trudging through a pool of slime
    sight: >
      The dark passage slopes into a pool of drainage from the roads of town, seeping in through cracks above
      you and wetting your hair with slime. There is an eerie feeling about this place, as if only the few and
      priviledged are welcome here.
