    sight: >
      The loners of Sundhaven gather here (figure *that* one out) to mourn their losses over gallons of liquid
      spirits. Occasionally, one can be seen passed out on the floor, robbed by some thief slipping in from
      the Nightbreak, but generally the livers here are stout from long and weary experiences.
