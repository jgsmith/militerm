    sight: >
      You stand before the southern gate,forged into ornaments of the triskelion in black iron and covered
      with ivy. Beyond it, days distant, the mountains of black glass rise shrouded in permanent night.
      Northwards lies the spread of the town of Sundhaven, hooded in wreaths of cooking smoke.
