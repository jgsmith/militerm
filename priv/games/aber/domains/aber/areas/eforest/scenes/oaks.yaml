    sight: >
      Your heart skips a beat as you enter this grove of trees. Without a doubt, this grove used to contain
      some of the strongest and most beautiful trees in the entire elven forest. Now, it looks as though a
      giant hand came down from the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
      The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which nature itself could never
      produce. Following the line of downed trees, you realize that it leads to a freshly hewn pathway in the
      mountains to the West.
