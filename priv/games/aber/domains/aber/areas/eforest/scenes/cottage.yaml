      You have entered the home of Dinthiar, the Elven King. It is a rather simple dwelling. A bed, table and
      chair are the only furnishings. However, the whole room is given a 'foresty' feel by the ivy which grows
      up the insides of the walls, and by the potted plants which hang from the ceiling. It is exactly the
      type of dwelling that you would expect an elf to have.
