    sight: >
      You have entered the throne room of Asmodeus, the Demon Lord who, in his battle with the evil lich,
      destroyed the beautiful elven forest. If that foul creature is still around, he must be destroyed! You
      rapidly glance around the room and see, in the middle of the room, a throne made out of human bones. You
      gag at the sight, and rapidly look for exits from this room. They lie to the South and West.
