    sight: >
      You are in a small clearing in the ruins of the elven forest. The ground in this clearing is blackened
      and infertile. The only sign of life here is a circle of toadstools which lie near the center of the
      glade. All around you is ruined forest. Just to the North, however, you think you see some greenery.
