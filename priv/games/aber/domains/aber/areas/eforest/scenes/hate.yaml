      All throughout this room are paintings of a gruesome undead beast. Without a doubt, it must be the Lich
      who, when fighting Asmodeus, was rumored to have helped cause the destruction of the elven forest. The
      fact that the Lich is an enemy of the demon lord here is made quite clear by the voice you hear chanting
      in your head. Over and over, you hear 'hate. hate. hate. hate...'
