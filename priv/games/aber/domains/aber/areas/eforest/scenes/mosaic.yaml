    short: Mosaic Room
    sight: >
      The entirity of this room is covered by a huge mosaic. It covers all of the walls, as well as the
      ceiling and the floor. You realize immediately that the area shown in the mosaic is that which mortals
      call the wasteland. You see images of fire, a sword of awesome power, crystal flame and a great djinni.
      For a moment, you almost become lost in the awesome vision. Flaming red letters in the center of the
      room spell out the words, HOME, SWEET, HOME.
