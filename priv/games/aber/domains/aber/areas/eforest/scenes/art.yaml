      This part of the Demonic museum seems to be entirely devoted to demonic art. The pieces are all quite
      horrific, and there is definitely nothing that would be valuable to sacrifice to the gods. You are
      almost drawn by a morbid curiosity to look at all of the terrifying &+Rpaintings.&* The only exit out of
      this awful place lies to the North.
