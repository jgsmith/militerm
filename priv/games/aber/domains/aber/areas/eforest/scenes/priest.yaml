    sight: >
      You stand in a room which is consumed by darkness. Shadows flicker every- where, seeming almost alive.
      For a moment, you worry that your light source may be extinguished. Glancing around, through the inky
      darkness, you realize that you are in some type of bed room. Evil religious icons and grotesque
      paintings line the walls. In the corner sits an &+Caltar&* which is covered by a dark red liquid.
      Without a doubt, this is the home of the Priest of the dark elves.
