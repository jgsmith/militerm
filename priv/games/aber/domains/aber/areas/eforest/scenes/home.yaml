    sight: >
      You have entered a small forested area of great beauty, in sharp contrast to the destruction to the
      south. About you, the sounds of nature abound. If not for the memory of the tainted forest to the south,
      you could become easily lost in the beauty here. Just to the East of you, partially hidden by healthy
      trees, is a small cottage. To the North and West are the mountains which seclude this valley.
