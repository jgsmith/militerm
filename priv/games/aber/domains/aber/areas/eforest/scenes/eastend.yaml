    sight: >
      You are now in the eastern section of the cathedral. A subdued glow emanates from a phosphorescent moss
      lining the walls and ceiling. Against the far eastern wall is a large &+Cthrone&* hewn from granite. A
      thick layer of dust covers everything. To the north, a passage leads to a small, brightly lit room.
