    sight: >
      You are standing in a room light by an unearthly glowing light. Howling shapes flow around a blackened
      altar in the center of the room, and you are surrounded by ghosts. Fortunately, none of the fearsome
      spirits seem to notice you. Exits from the room lead to the east and north.
