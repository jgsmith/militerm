    sight: >
      You stand just inside the temple of the dark elves. Looking around, you realize that it is quite
      beautiful, even though the beauty seems somehow evil. You are chilled by a sense of foreboding as you
      think of what dark acts may have been committed inside this place of worship, for some nameless evil
      god. You see small archways out of this room to the North and West.
