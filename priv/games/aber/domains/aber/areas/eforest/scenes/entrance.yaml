    short: The Cave Entrance
    sight: >
      You stand at the entrance to what appears to be a vast system of caves. A cool breeze strikes you in the
      face as you peer ahead into the blackness, and you sense strong evil emanating from the cavern. To the
      west, you see the blackened mouth of the cave, to the east, a downward sloping passage leads to
      darkness.
