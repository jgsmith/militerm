    short: Warped Glen
    sight: >
      You have wandered into a small glen which is grotesquely warped. Trees form weird, diabolical shapes,
      and the area seems pervaded by the stench of brimstone. You gag to avoid breathing the fouled air. To
      the North and West are the mountains which shield this valley. It is quite unfortunate that they did not
      protect the forest from whatever destroyed it...
