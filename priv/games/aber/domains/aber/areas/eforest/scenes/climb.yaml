    sight: >
      You are walking on a steep mountain path which leads over the top of the mountain to the east and
      downwards towards a ravaged forest to the North. You suspect that the view here would be quite beautiful
      if not for the noxious fumes wafting up from the forest below, which cause your eyes to constantly
      water. Looking at the forest, you believe that it must have once been quite beautiful.
