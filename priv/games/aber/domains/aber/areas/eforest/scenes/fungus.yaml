    sight: >
      You are quite delighted to find that this cavern is much cooler than the surrounding ones. In fact, the
      change in temperature is so dramatic that you begin to shiver uncontrollably. All about this room are
      various types of fungus. You can make out familiar Toadstools and Mushrooms. In addition, you see more
      much exotic fungus that you have never encountered before. Perhaps, you think, you are the only mortal
      to ever have ventured this far into the earth. Other natural caverns lie to the North and South.
