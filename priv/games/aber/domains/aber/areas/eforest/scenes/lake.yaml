      Although not as cool as the marvelous fungus cavern, this room is much more comfortable than the
      surrounding caves. In the center of this cavern is a large &+Blake&*. Looking over the walls, you notice
      strange writing. To you, it almost looks like elven writing, somehow corrupted. Overall, the entire
      cavern seems quite gloomy. You better leave this place before you get real depressed!
