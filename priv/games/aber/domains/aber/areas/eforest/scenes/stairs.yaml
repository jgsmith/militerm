    sight: >
      You have no doubt in your mind that the stairs in the middle of this room must go down to hell itself.
      If you thought the earlier rooms were hot, you were obviously sadly mistaken. Here, every breath you
      take burns your lungs. Your skin is already beginning to blister from the intense heat, and you are
      worried that your clothing may spontaneously combust! As well, flames appear in the corners of this room
      and the smell of brimstone is so strong that it makes you want to vomit immediately. Surely, nothing but
      Hades itself could lie in the Inferno below...
