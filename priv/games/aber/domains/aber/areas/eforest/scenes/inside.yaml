      You gasp out in awe at the quiet beauty of this hidden hollow. Looking around, 'majesty' is the word
      which immediately comes to mind. The entire room draws your eyes upwards, like some ancient gothic
      cathedral. There, among the arched, wooden roof, are numerous tiny flowers, hanging from the vines which
      grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant hues of the flowers - red, violet, blue, green,
      and white - stand out. Indeed, they glow with their own light, providing the majority of the
      illumination in this room and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows around the room. As you stare at
      them, something tugs at your memory. You have seen that pattern somewhere before... It is the pattern of
      the stars in the night sky, but of a color and brightness that the night sky can only hint at. As your
      eyes slowly refocus on the mundane plane, you notice a wooden &+Ythrone&* set near the middle of this
      room. With a start, you realize that is has been grown from the tree itself. Once, the whole elven
      forest must have been like this...
