    sight: >
      You are in a grove of tall trees which seem tainted. They glow with a sickly green glow which speaks of
      evil, pestilence and disease. You suppress a shudder and view your surroundings. To the south and west
      lie this forest's protective mountains, while woods lie to the east. To the North, a wide swath of
      destructions cuts into the heart of this realm.
