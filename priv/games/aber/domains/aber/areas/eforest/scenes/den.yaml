      You have entered Asmodeus' study. In the center of the room is a &+Cdesk&*, which you realize is covered
      with human skin. Putting that thought out of your mind you look around the rest of the room. The walls
      are made of the red rock that is common throughout the caves and the smell of sulphur, like always, all
      but overwhelms you. Still, your eyes keep returning to that gruesome desk. Looking for exits to this
      room, you find three. They lie to the North, East and South.
