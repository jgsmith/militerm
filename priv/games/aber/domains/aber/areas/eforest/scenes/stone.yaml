    sight: >
      You stand in a perfectly cubical room, obviously not natural. What makes the room eerie is the fact that
      no signs of construction are visible. It is almost as if the entire room sprung from the earth in its
      present shape. To the South you hear the sounds of liquid boiling, while to the north, beyond a perfect
      archway, you see what looks like a throne room.
