      You stand in a large room which seems to have been well kept. It has none of the squalor of the barracks
      to the North. There is a neat bed here, as well as an organized desk. However, the entire room is
      covered by a layer of dust. Obviously, these quarters have not been used for quite some time. The only
      exit is to the North.
