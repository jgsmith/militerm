    sight: >
      You have entered what could only be a demonic museum. All about you are statues and paintings, most of
      which are quite grotesque. You see sculptures of demons torturing humans in many gruesome ways, as well
      as paintings of what must be Hades. The whole sight is quite sickening. Doors lead North, East and South
      into additional museum rooms, while to the west lies the exit to this perverted place.
