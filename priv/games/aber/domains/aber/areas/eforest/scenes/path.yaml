    sight: >
      You are walking down a forest path which seems less corrupted than the surrounding areas. Some wildlife
      still lives, and the trees are not rotting or dead. You see some of the beauty which once existed in
      this realm. To the north of you lies more vibrant forest, while to the south you see only destruction.
