    sight: >
      You cry out in horror as you witness what has been done to this forest. All about, trees lie downed, as
      if hewn by some giant axe. However, even the twisted corpses of the trees seem unnatural. Somehow, a
      single oak &+Gtree&* in the center of the swath of destruction seems to have survived. It lies just to
      the east of you. To the west, the line of destruction seems to continue. Mercifully, mountains to the
      east protected any further realms from this corruption.
