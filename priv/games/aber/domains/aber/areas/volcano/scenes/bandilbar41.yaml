    sight: >
      You are in a vast cavern filled with thousands of ant eggs. As you watch, lava seeps into the cavern at
      the far end and begins to overwhelm the eggs. You smile, satisfied of a job well done. To the east is
      another chamber. The air is stiflingly hot in here and you begin to sweat.
