    sight: >
      You are in a wide chamber, carved into an almost perfect sphere. It is very warm here, and you can hear
      a faint roaring sound and a rumbling coming from below. Rows of shelves on the northern wall are stacked
      with empty storage jars, each smelling vaguely of honey. You can hear faint voices coming from beyond
      the north wall.
