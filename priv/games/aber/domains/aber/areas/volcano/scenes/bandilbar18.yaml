    sight: >
      You are at the southern edge of the wood. To the south the river, curling around from the east, runs
      approximately due west, passing under the shadow of the great volcano. A narrow rope bridge spans the
      river, and on the other side you see a broad road leading south between an imposing pair of iron gates
      into the ever-changing town of the wizards of Crossroads MUD.
