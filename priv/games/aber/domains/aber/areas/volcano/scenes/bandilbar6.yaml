    sight: >
      Whether once river barges made the long haul up the river from here, or merely traded with downstream
      ports, you have no idea, but you are certain of one thing: this pier has not been in use for a good
      century or more. Dank mosses cling to the rotting planks, and most of the wooden supports are missing or
      broken beyond repair. Sheltered under the shoulder of the mountain as this is, with the river on the one
      hand, there is nowhere you can go from here except back to the south.
