    sight: >
      You are in a tunnel with perfectly smooth walls, leading west from here. You guess it must lead
      somewhere important, because it is spotlessly clean and a lot of care has gone into its fashioning. Just
      south of here the main tunnel runs past, heading towards the entrance.
