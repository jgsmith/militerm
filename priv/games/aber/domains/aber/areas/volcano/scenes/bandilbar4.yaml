      You are progressing along an old road, once busy with traffic, now grass- covered and forgotten. It
      continues east and west from here, but to the west it crosses a swiftly-moving river which hurries by as
      if anxious to leave the area as soon as possible. There is a bridge over the river, and a decaying pier
      to the north of the bridge suggests that there was once some traffic along the river, although you
      cannot imagine how any boat could possibly travel upstream from here.
