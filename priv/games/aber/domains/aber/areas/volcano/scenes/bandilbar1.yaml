      You are making your way around a shoulder of the mountain, perched somewhat precariously on a narrow
      ledge which ends to the west. Unless you head back on to the path just east of you, the only other way
      seems to be a scramble down a gully to the south. The going will be tricky, but not impossible, and your
      return ascent would appear to be manageable.
