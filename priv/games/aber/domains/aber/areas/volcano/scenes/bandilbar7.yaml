    sight: >
      You are at the north-eastern gate of the village of Yorrin. As you look around, you are somewhat
      surprised to note a distinct lack of activity. The place is as silent as the grave, and a shiver runs up
      and down your spine as you pause to consider what could possibly be the explanation for this. To the
      west is the village's main street.
