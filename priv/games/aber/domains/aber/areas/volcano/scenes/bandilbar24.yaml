    sight: >
      The paving stones leading towards Mount Bandilbar are covered with a fine yellow layer of sulphur, the
      product of the volcano's foul and increasingly frequent belching. To the west the path descends into a
      channel which runs alongside the mountain for some way to the north and south. To the north of here is a
      small wood.
