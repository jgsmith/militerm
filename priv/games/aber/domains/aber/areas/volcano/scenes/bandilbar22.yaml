      You are in a small open glade, where no trees are growing due to the poor quality of the soil here,
      which is suffused with a yellow tint that indicates the presence of sulphur. Whether it has boiled up
      from beneath at some point or fallen from above you cannot tell, but it effectively prevents any plants
      from growing within an area of twenty square yards or more.
