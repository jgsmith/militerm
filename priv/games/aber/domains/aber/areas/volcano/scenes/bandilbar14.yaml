    short: Edge Of Yorrin Wood
    sight: >
      You are at the northern edge of a wood which continues south and west from here. The trees are
      widely-spaced and dainty of stature, and therefore more friendly and less intimidating than most of the
      woods you have recently had occasion to pass through. The broken gates of the village of Yorrin lie to
      the west.
