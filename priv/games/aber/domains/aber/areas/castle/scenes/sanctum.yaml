      This is the stately room where the Lords and Ladies of court would wait to be entertained by the King of
      the Castle, although now the tapestries hang in shreds on the walls and all the treasures that once
      stood on pedestals have been smashed or stolen... it would appear that the castle has been raided and
      the King overthrown. Archways lead north and south.
