    sight: >
      You find yourself in the guard room for the castle. Bunks line the walls, and weapon racks stand in the
      center of the room, though they are all empty now. Judging by the upturned tables and chairs and the
      dried blood on the floor you think that the guards may not have left on a Sunday afternoon stroll. A
      single narrow doorway leads east.
