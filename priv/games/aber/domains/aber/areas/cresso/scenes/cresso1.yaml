      You enter a nice bedroom. There is a huge bed in the center of the room. The person who owns this room
      must be a pretty important one. Also, this probably means that you are not supposed to be in here. This
      room isn't realy part of this world. It somehow contains elements from another dimension. Like an obese
      cat and a slot machine. There is a closet on the south side of the room. The ambiance is fantastic. You
      feel like you could stay here forever.
