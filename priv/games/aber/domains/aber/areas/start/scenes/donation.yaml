    short: The Donations Room
    sight: >
      This room is full of things that players before you were thoughtful enough to donate. Items found in
      this room are as good as they normally are, and have the same properties, but they aren't worth any
      points. There are exits west and south from here. Upstairs is the entrance to the Welcome Centre.
