    sight: >
      The marsh here is just as bad as the rest of surrounding area. The awful smell of raw sewage permeates
      the air, the waters are thick and hard to move through, and your body is fighting you at every step. You
      know you must find dry land soon, or you will collapse of utter exhaustion.
