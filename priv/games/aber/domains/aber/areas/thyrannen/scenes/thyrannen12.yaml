    sight: >
      At this point the forest continues in all directions. To the east the forest hooks south. To the south
      the forest appears to reach a dead-end. While to the north the forest turns east. Directly to the east
      is what appears to be the center of the forest. The forest seems to come alive here, the branches are
      rustling, yet there is no wind...
