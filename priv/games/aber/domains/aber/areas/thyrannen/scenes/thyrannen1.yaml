    sight: >
      You are standing atop of the first in a series of many rolling hills that continue on to the south. The
      smell of grass and flowers fills your lungs. The sight is very breath-taking. On ahead in the distance
      is a very large mountain range that juts up seemingly out of nowhere. The mountains look more unnatural
      than normal mountains. They appear as if they were the work of a demented god.
