    sight: >
      This is the south-western corner of the forest, ahead to the west you can see a small hut, and to the
      north is the large expanse of the forest. There is a large garden here, filled with many different
      vegetables, all rather large. The garden is larger than any other you have seen in your life, whoever
      has taken the time to sow this wonderful garden must be an expert gardener.
