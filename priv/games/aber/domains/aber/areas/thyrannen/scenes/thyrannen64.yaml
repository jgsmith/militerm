      You have reached a dead-end. The only exit is back to the west. This is a large room, the result of
      heavy mining in the past few years, there are piles of rocks in several places around the room, as well
      as a birdcage located in the center of the room. The bird looks as if it has been dead for some time,
      making you wonder about the quality of the air in this cavernous room.
