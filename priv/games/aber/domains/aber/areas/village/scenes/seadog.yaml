    sight: >
      You are standing in the 'Old Seadog' inn. The inn radiates age and charm, with its oak beam roof, and
      many seafaring momentos secured firmly around the walls. Even the bar is a single thick oak slab, worn
      and chipped with years of service to rowdy sailors. The door out is west.
