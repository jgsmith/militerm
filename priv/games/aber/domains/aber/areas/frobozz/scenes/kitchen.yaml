    sight: >
      You are in a tiny kitchen. The strong smell of food indicates that something edible has been prepared
      here recently. A few empty shelves line the eastern wall and under them is a bench. The bench bears the
      marks of a very sharp knife being used for the preparation of food. A bricked chimney is standing at the
      south wall. A narrow stair ascends into darkness, while a doorway leads south into a livingroom. A small
      window is set into the western wall.
