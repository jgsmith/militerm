      This is probably the place where the once mighty and powerfull Wizard of Frobozz developed his spells
      and potions. There is a long, wide and very sturdy workbench here. Attached to it are handcuffs and
      chained clammers used for keeping strong beings immovable. Deep marks in the bench bears signs of a
      hooved animal once held here against its will.
