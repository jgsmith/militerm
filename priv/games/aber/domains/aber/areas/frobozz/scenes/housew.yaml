    sight: >
      You are standing west of the small white house, which has a small window set into the wall. The view
      westwards is magnificent, showing a deep canyon cutting through the landscape from the north and
      southwards. On the other side of the canyon you can see vast fields stretching several miles into the
      land before ending where a big mountainrange cuts out through the surface of the earth. This view
      certainly makes the white house look small and insign- ificant, which at its western wall offers nothing
      but a small window. There is a tiny little path going around the house to the north and south here.
