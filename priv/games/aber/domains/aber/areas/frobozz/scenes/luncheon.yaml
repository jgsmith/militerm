    sight: >
      You have just entered the bank-personells luncheon room. The room is abandoned just af if something
      terrible has happened. They did not even have time to clear the place from the waste and rubbish from
      their meals. The mess surely indicates that they didn't wait guests to pop in. There is a door in the
      south wall and an entrance into the more important parts of the bank.
