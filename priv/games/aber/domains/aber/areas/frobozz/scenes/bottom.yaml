      You are standing by the east wall of an enormous cavern. This cavern is in fact a huge reservoir of
      water, and stretching out before you to the west is an artificial damwall. Up to the north is a steep
      stairway, and one step up from the ground right east of you is a large and heavy steeldoor, which is
      corroded stuck in an open position. The east end of the damwall is south.
