    sight: >
      This is the livingroom of the small white house, and in earlier days it must have been at least a bit
      comfortable, but now it offers nothing. The windows are boarded shut with nailed pieces of planks and
      the remaining parts of furniture and a large oriental &+yrug&* are badly ravaged. There is a single exit
      north into the kitchen.
