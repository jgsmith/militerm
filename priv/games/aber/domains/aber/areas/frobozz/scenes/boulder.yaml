    sight: >
      This tunnel east of the bank is stopped abruptly by a boulder which fills the tunnel with rock from
      grinded stone-dust size up to the size of rocks whick will never be moved by humans alone. Even a mouse
      won't be able to crawl through this boulder. Thus, the only exit for you is to the west.
