    sight: >
      You are in a steep and narrow tunnel leading up. This tunnel has certainly not been used by to many
      guests, because the steeps are still rough hewn and not worn down like other stairs in the area. It has
      probably been used only by people who once upon a time took care of the dam. Down to the west is a large
      and sturdy steeldoor leading back into the cavern.
