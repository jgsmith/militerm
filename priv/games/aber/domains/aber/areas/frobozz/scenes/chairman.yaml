      It is clear from the size both the room and its contents that this must be the chairman's office. The
      room measuring about 10 times 8 yards contains nothing of excess, but the stuff that has been placed
      here is of extraordinary quality and must surely have costed many a tellers wages. Right in front of you
      completly dominating the room is a large mahogny desk which is one of the bigger you have seen. Right
      behind it placed up to the wall is a cupboard which in quality and splendor must have been made by
      Chippendale himself. More descretely in one corner an inviting sitting-group almost begs you to take a
      seat. To the south an opening leads into the tellers' room.
