      You are overcome by a feeling of tremendous grief for the land around you. It is almost as if someone
      came here and ripped the life away from the land. The bare cracked soil beneath is light brown and dry.
      To the &+CWest&* is a shimmering haze, while an ominous cavern lies to the &+CSouth&*. The wasteland
      continues &+CEast&* and a small mud-hut is &+CNorth&*.
