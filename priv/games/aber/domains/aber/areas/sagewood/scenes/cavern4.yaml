    short: The Edge Of The Lava Flow
    sight: >
      All around you is a vast river of boiling lava which is more fluid than water and extremely hot.
      Occasionally a wave of the lava washes ashore, taking some of the rock with it. Any wise adventurer
      would leave soon! Anything thrown into the lava would surely be destroyed...
