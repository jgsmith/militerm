    short: Gloomy Plains
    sight: >
      As you enter the plains, you feel a surge of gloom fill your body. All around you are dry, dying
      grasses, flowers, and trees. You sense that this was once a beautiful place, ravaged by some dark magic.
      The plain leads both &+CSouth&* and &+CNorth&*. A hill lies to the &+CWest&*. To the &+CEast&* is a
      ravaged clearing.
