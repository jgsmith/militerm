    sight: >
      The Sun's light is blocked by the dense evil-looking trees which seem to be in competion to reach the
      light. Many trees here are dead, on the brink of falling over, starved out by the other trees. The
      ground is a horrendous maze of tripping roots. A clearing is &+CWest&*, and a sinister altar is
      &+CEast&*. Even more trees stand like dark sentries to the &+CSouth&*. The fetid stench of an old bog
      wafts in from the &+CNorth&*.
