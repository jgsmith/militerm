    short: Gloomy Plains
    sight: >
      As you enter the plains, you feel a surge of gloom fill your body. All around you are dry, dying
      grasses, flowers, and trees. You sense that this was once a beautiful place, ravaged by some dark magic.
      The plain extends both to the &+CWest&* and &+CEast&*. To the &+CSouth&* is a hill which seems to stand
      out from everything else.
