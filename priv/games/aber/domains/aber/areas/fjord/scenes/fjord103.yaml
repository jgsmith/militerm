    sight: >
      The water is sparkling clear, yet not as deep as the inlet or the ocean. Shining pristinely beneath only
      thirty feet of cold water is where the two icy fingers of the Nolak Fjord submerge and meet. The inlet
      forms the contents of this underwater ice bowl, and the icebar has made the current travel both ways
      across it. There are certain places that sailing ships must enter and leave the inlet at. The icebar
      also serves as the separator between two environments. On the inlet side, the small waves harmlessly
      slap against the icebar, causing minor splashes and undertows, while the ocean side has been worn smooth
      by the increased pressure of waves generated far out to sea.
