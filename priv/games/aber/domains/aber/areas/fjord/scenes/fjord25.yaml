    sight: >
      The beach slopes downward into a wide ditch, where the bottom is filled with lake water. A stretch of
      sand leads south to where the ditch ends at a wall of muddy earth. This used to be stream which fed out
      of the lake to the lower valleys. Now the high tides of the lake generated by the central whirlpool
      drive some water into the sandy bed, keeping it moist. During the late spring and summer, the ditch is a
      natural spawning ground for many kinds of fish.
