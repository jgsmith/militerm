      The northern boundary of this section of the pasture is marked by a rusty, creaking cattle gate,
      drifting open and closed slightly in the wind. Narrow trails wind their way around a few randomly placed
      grave sites and pool together by this gate. Leading northward is a wider, well-groomed gravel trail, its
      sides accurately spaced by rocks lining the length of the trail.
