      Eddies swirl around your craft in this calm area of the lake. There is only a light wind to disturb the
      surface, although to the south the waters build up into small waves. There is a rather large hole in the
      water to the north. Around the reflection of the sun on the lake swim a school of trout, while a catfish
      makes a giant leap across the width of it.
