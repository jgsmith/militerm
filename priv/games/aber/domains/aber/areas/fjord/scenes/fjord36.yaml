    short: Pit of Fungus
    sight: >
      Your first step brings you sinking waist-deep into white, gooey muck. The air is alive with the ripeness
      of death, as the muck lining the bottom half of the pit is a large soup of fungal decay. Growing above
      the soup are mushrooms which actually are alive and patiently wait the day when they, too can become
      'one with the soup.' Gnarled roots from nearby pines and undergrowth reach down into the muck and draw
      life-giving nutrients, leaving you with all the smelly stuff! Sunlight drifts in from the north, but
      doesn't cause even the slightest reactions of photosynthesis here.
