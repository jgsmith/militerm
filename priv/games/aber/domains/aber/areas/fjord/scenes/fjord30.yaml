    short: Deer Track Extension
    sight: >
      Within the confines of the Muskrat Pines, the hallowed sounds of near total silence draw in traveler's
      empathy with the world of nature. The deer track continues to meander north and south, and the silence
      cannot be disrupted even by wandering from the trail. The animals abide by their granted environment and
      violate it only as necessary to survive, which explains the signs of feasting and excrement. A large
      collection of Sap Swarmers gather, and one pounces on a young, freckled fawn as the startled deer's
      curiosity draws it too close. Fortunately, the father is nearby and uses its antlers to pry the swarmer
      off before too much damage is done. With a dismissal wave of antlers, the buck leads his son back to
      where the family had been dining previously.
