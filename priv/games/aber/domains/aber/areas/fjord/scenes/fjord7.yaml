    short: Small Pine Grove
    sight: >
      A heavy cluster of wayward pines are grouped together irregularly away from the major bulk of the
      forest. The trail leads in a complete circle around the grove via a fork in the path. Every pine in this
      grove, however, has been struck by lightning, their tops burnt to cinders. From each lifeless trunk
      protrudes new shoots for future growth. Mingled within the remaining branches are a few &+ynests&*, and
      chirps from baby birds getting fed their earthly delight of squiggling earthworms bring new sparks of
      life to this shattered grove.
