    short: Sulphurous Cave
    sight: >
      The interior of the cave is lined with hidden crevices and fissures which pump forth yellowish, pungent
      clouds of gas with no particular pattern or frequency. Porous rock makes up the walls, and there are a
      significant number of small bones strewn about, as if something once used this room as a home. Nestled
      against the back is the remains of a grass nest, matted down and decayed by the sulfur gas. Next to it
      lies a small puddle of bubbling orange goo, fed by a vent directly underneath it. Fresh air and light
      may be found beyond the cove opening to the west.
