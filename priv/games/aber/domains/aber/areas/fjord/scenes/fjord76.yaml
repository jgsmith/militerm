      This raised section of a cooled volcanic lava flow tapers up to a perfectly flat and smooth square.
      Fireballs from the Dark City below explode high up into the volcano and briefly illuminate this area,
      bringing forth the nearby mountain wall in all of its stark glory. Like its counterpart at the other end
      of the city, this magical spot allows transport both within and without of Mount Phaylax. Volcanic
      slopes lead down to the avenue of Loolander.
