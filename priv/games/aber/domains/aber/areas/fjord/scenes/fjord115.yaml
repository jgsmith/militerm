      The main residential area is not as neat as some of the townsfolk would have outsiders believe. Not
      wishing to dump their garbage into the northern sea or the woods for fear of spoiling the fragile
      ecology, they elect instead to dump the less smelly portions along the sides of the road. Yet the houses
      themselves are impeccable, each glistening like it was just painted and permanently sealed away from the
      elements.
