      The waves clap against each other with medium force, sending sprays of salty foam high into the air. A
      powerful wind roars about, leaving no doubt that thers is no cover about. The sun shines down cleanly
      through the crisp, cold air, saturating the surface of the sea with mirror images of itself, while a
      light gray overhaze continues to be randomly blown about. To the east the seas become utterly
      destructive and unnavigable by the sheer amounts of broken-off polar pack ice present.
