      Sap concentrations increase further to the east, its production fueled by the significant amounts of
      light and water in that direction. Clinging to most trees in at least three places are the only life
      form unique to this forest. The Sap Swarmers are a distant cousin of the small blood-sucking leeches,
      but gorge themselves on sap instead of the liquid of life. They are equipped with serrated claws which
      cut through the protective lichen and bark of the pine and allow access to the phloem, where the pine
      sap is readily available, but are careful to avoid causing permanent damage to the tree. Sap Swarmers
      lack eyes and ears, but have a wonderful detection system of shape and dimension, which is why they will
      sometimes try to attach themselves to a passing organism. The forest thickens to the west and thins to
      the east.
