    sight: >
      The central area of the lake is a giant whirlpool. Water and surface matter are drawn counterclockwise
      to am calm ring ten feet beneath the lake surface, forming a large sunken pit of water. Once something
      is drawn into the pit, it spirals down and then spits back up to the rim through means of enormous air
      bubbles. This whirlpool is, therefore, not considered dangerous, but used as a fun ride and a small
      challenge to escape.
