    sight: >
      Forged and broken in years ago, this path has been kept in excellent condition. It is clear of weeds and
      minor rockslides as it follows a steady-grade and relatively safe path up and around the mountain. Far
      below you is the treeline, and shadows play overhead as the condensation clouds drift slowly.
