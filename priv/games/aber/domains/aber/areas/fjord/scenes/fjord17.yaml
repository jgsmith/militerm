    short: Rickety Pier
    sight: >
      The boards creak underneath your weight. The pier was excellently made to have been able to stand for as
      long as it has. Beneath the waters of the lake, the ground quickly vanishes from view. This area for the
      pier was selected because of the deep hole here, where the bigger trout and catfish choose to reside.
      The pier ends near the edge of this hole as to allow fisherpersons the most possible area of the hole to
      fish in.
