      The spirit of the evil northern winds has this wide boulevard named in its honor. Stretching from the
      plaza to the south to the mountain wall due north, this street has most of the housing districts on it.
      Skyscrapers housing thousands of minions of the dark stretch way up into the dark ceiling that leads up
      the main shaft of the crater. Way overhead, a dim gray reveals the opening to this world. To the north,
      the volcano wall crashes into the ground, cutting off the avenue.
