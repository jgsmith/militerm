    sight: >
      Here a gully leads due east and west along a rocky slant, providing easy cross-country access. It comes
      to an end at an open stretch of gravel - the result of a landslide long ago. The slide did not manage to
      get a tree right beside it, though, and the tree lived to a ripe old age as originally intended. Now the
      deceased husk remains with the insides eaten out, but its formidable root growth has prevented earth
      from filling in the hollow center within itself. The bulb appears big enough for a small elk to enter
      and take temporary refuge.
