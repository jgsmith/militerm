    sight: >
      A slew of fallen trees criss-cross the deer track here. Bugs inhabit crevices in the rot-eaten &+ylogs&*
      of what used to be tree trunks. The stench of decay is thick and rich, but the humidity of the
      atmosphere does begin to falter finally. It drops to the north and is greater in the less odorific areas
      to the south. The ground also begins to get hilly to the north as moss-covered stumps clamor upward from
      earthen mounds. The Sap Swarmers diminish to the north, perhaps unnerved by the slight climatic changes.
      Their home live relatively far to the south anyway. However, one striking change is that there are
      practically no deer living in this section of the Muskrat. The foliage remains relatively unscathed, and
      no blueberry-like droppings are present.
