      Some dead grass, windblown sand particles, and pieces or rotting bark litter the ground within this once
      great trunk. Off to one side neatly stacked in a tier are some fresh-looking &+ypinecones&*. The cones
      provide most of the color to this otherwise dead shell of a conifer. However, scratchings on the inside
      walls reveal more than simple animal claw marks; they are made in a fashion precise enough to be
      letters. The bark is cut by intricate patterns formed by these letters and their accompanying images of
      a circle surrounded by several outgoing rays. This area has not been so damaged by the fire which raged
      throughout the rest of the tree. A light breeze blows in from the west, bringing the smell of the meadow
      and more sand from the beach.
