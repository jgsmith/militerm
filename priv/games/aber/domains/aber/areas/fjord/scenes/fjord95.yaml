    sight: >
      Made out of sturdy, thick pine wood, this building has withstood the tests of time and debate. The
      council of twelve of Kyerstarn, in addition to the elected leader, Rankine Hugoniot, meet in this center
      of village government once a month to discuss issues of commerce and how well the the village is doing.
      Previously, the issue of the weakening of the veil guarding this world from Fallenthorp has arisen.
      Battles with the undead are not taken lightly by the citizens of this concerned town, given their
      proximity to Mount Phaylax. Today, the hall is deserted, and the council members are out helping to
      raise capital for the village.
