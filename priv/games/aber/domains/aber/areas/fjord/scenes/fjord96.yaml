    sight: >
      The bazaar continues down the sodden, muddy ground of the center of the Kyerstarn village. Hubbub all
      around feeds the festive and busy atmosphere as the grains of the Muskrats are traded by paper agreement
      and confidence in the good. Young urchins of Kyerstarn ride by on their latest homemade inventions -
      two-person balances connected to a series of pulleys which run off the idea of a bicycle, but are more
      stable.
