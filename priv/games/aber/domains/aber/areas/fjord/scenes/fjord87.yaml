    sight: >
      Two fingers of the mountains reach far out into the sea, tapering together somewhere out in the open
      sea, forming a protected inlet here. A small harbor is set off the trail, with a ramshackle boatshop and
      business office. Waves crash against the icy ground full force with their cold touch, showing no mercy
      to the shoreline.
