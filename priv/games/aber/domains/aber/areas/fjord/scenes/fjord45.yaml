    sight: >
      Wind moves at near forty knots on this ledge. A dirty line in the snow at your feet marks the point of
      no return two feet in from the edge of the glacier. Dropping nearly six thousand feet to a basin of
      sparkling blue snow melt, the icy, reflective surface allows no pretense for the wild ride that ensues
      for any brave enough to slide the length. Shelter, and the trail, are found back to the west.
