      To keep those who visit the village safe and warm, with good food and a comfortable bed, the Hunterton
      family has carried this dormitory in their name for nearly nine generations. In all that time, the
      stories and insights gleaned from the merchants who stay here have become legendary comical matters
      among the current owning Hunterton. Beds stacked three high stretch back, with decent-sized footlockers
      and shelves available for storage. Chambers against one wall with barrels of heated water and drawing
      curtains provide places to bathe and refresh oneself in while small windows just above eyelevel provide
      a view of the village.
