    short: The Spawning Vats
    sight: >
      Nearly overpowering the volcanic fumes in the air are those coming from an entire valley of bubbling and
      simmering vats. Lined up in thirty rows of nearly five hundred to each row are the source of the ghouls
      and lizard spawn for the entire Dark City. Hand-carved wells into an extremely deep lava flow are filled
      with an oily, milky-colored fluid which swirls and bubbles with no particular pattern. A continuous
      stream of popping noises announces the 'birth' of a new spawn, where it is taken by an appropriate
      lizard or ghoul attendant and given its place of residence, armor, and a twisted black blade. The
      closeness of the two species usually ends up in death for both sides, but here at the vat, the magic of
      the darkness which surrounds and envelops this city prevents any fights from starting. Their warring is
      meant to be meaningless and eternal.
