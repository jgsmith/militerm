      Something awful has been here! Trees have been ripped from their roots and shoved aside as if they were
      no more than toothpicks. The forest floor is trampled down by enormous &+yfeet&*; the spacing between
      the toes measures no less than a yard across. Webbing spans that spacing, given the near total leveling
      of the undergrowth. Light shines much more strongly from the north, towards the border of the Muskrat
      Pine Forest, as a result of the destructive travel. The rejoicing chirping of crickets echoes in this
      section as the little green and black pests come to inhabit the fallen trunks. Fresh sap runs over those
      trees, implying that this chaos happened recently. To the west and east, the forest drops in altitude
      slightly, but rises considerably to the north.
