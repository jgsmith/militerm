      The little shanty housing all the bait seemingly ever needed to catch every fish in the world has
      windows which shudder with the passing of the outside wind. On many pegboard racks lining the walls are
      the many fishing rods which are used to expertly catch the inlet fish. Stacked in one corner and tagged
      by name are the tackle boxes containing the personal arsenals of bait type, line strength, and an
      assorted array of nasty- looking fishhooks. Balanced woodenly against one wall is a 'jhata' - a small,
      one-person craft which resembles a kayak, but is much more streamlined and lightweight. Should anything
      threatening enter the inlet, people using such a boat would be likely to leave the finned swimmer in the
      dust.
