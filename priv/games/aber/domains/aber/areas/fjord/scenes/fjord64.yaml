    sight: >
      An area of the ridge has been leveled out to make a smooth surface. At the end opposite the shrine
      entrance, there stands an altar, erected from the same black glassy lava as the ridge. On top of it is a
      diamond brazier in which burns a blue flame streaked with ebony. It hisses vivid red sparks and is
      unaffected by the roaring wind through the shrine. Two torches stand to either side of the altar in
      carved stands roughly nine feet high, providing additional light. The only exit is out of the shrine.
