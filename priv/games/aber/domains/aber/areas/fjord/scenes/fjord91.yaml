    sight: >
      The slickness of the road reflects ultraviolet light quite nicely with its total whiteness and causes
      things to seem closer then they are. The road follows the shoreline fairly closely around part of the
      inlet, but not so that the icy mist of the sea drenches it continuously. To the east there is a large
      fishing village, while the inlet harbor is to the west.
