    short: Icefloe
    sight: >
      A small continent of smooth, crystalline ice covers this stretch of the northern seas. Not a single
      living thing has grown out here as the powerful forces of erosion prevent any nutrients from sticking
      around long enough to do their jobs. The floe is dying though; occasionally, pieces of itself will break
      off and float away to join their polar brethren outside the area which the local sea serpents inhabit.
      Only these serpents possess strength enough to push the icebergs around at whim.
