    short: Inlet of the Werewolf
    sight: >
      The hardiest and tastiest of the northern saltwater fish species can be found in this inlet during the
      summer, when they come here in droves to reproduce and lay their eggs. Occasionally, a shark will follow
      schools in and snap a few unsuspecting fish before the rest of the school has time to turn around and
      gang up on the shark. The shark is driven out and never returns. Within the inlet, the ocean waves are
      relatively minor and provide easy rocking motion in which to relax and let all of life's worries go.
      This is the way of the villagers to the southeast, as they make a killing of a living off of fishing in
      this cove. They also pass their time telling repeated stories of a great aquatic terror in the open sea,
      with the mouth, speed, and ferocity of a werewolf. The inlet is so named in the honor of the tale which
      has kept many a petrified child awake.
