    sight: >
      The Phaylax Trail levels out into a bowl shaped section of the volcano slope. Small geothermal geysers
      vent into the lake, bubbling through it and keeping it from freezing. The lake is biologically dead,
      though. Not even single-cell organisms occupy these waters with the presence of the shades so nearby. A
      peninsula of black lava rock sticks out into the lake like an angry blister, where a small diamond boat
      is tethered to one of the sharp rocky points.
