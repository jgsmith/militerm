    sight: >
      A light flurry blows continuously within this part of the mountain range. Peakes of varying height and
      shape tower around you as the trail winds back and forth through them, unused to the presence of a mere
      human and the gaze of mortal eyes. The temperature is well below freezing, allowing no form of natural
      life. A dark shape looms through the clouds to the northwest.
