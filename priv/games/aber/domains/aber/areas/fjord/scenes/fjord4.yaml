      A bed of dry, dead pine &+yneedles&* provides a natural layer of undergrowth within an otherwise
      man-made structure. A wooden &+ycask&* with its rusting bands decays at its own pace and will never
      likely hold any ales again. Stuffed away in a back corner is a small fireplace, fashioned with a hanging
      apparatus which supports a dented, cast-iron &+ypot&*. The bed is not so fortunate, however. Its frame
      has splintered to dust and collapsed into a small pile of termite-eaten debris, and the straw
      &+ymattress&* is musty and decomposing. The only other pieces of furniture in the room are a simple
      wooden rocking chair and a &+ychest&* of drawers, both of which lean at angles enough to make the human
      eye ache.
