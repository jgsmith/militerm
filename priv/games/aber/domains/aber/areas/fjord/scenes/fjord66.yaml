    short: The Dark City
    sight: >
      Clusters of black lava rock buildings make up this town, where to even lean against one to rest is to
      invite puncture wounds and whatever toxins lay on the surfaces. This is the central plaza of the city.
      Black roads lead away from it to the resident districts. Small plumes of fire explode into reality from
      pressured gases within the volcano vents, momentarily outlining each stark window against a black
      background. Ghostly images drift in the plaza building windows, giving rise to an alarming number of
      inhabiting shadow people. The bleak and voted least desirable town (on the level of hell intersecting
      the world of life) of Fallenthorp does not get many tourists.
