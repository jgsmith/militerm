    sight: >
      The pine forest never intrudes upon this wide expanse of grass, where small children can easily get lost
      in. Flax, oats, and rye grow in abundance in different sections of the meadow. Deer hop along nearby,
      eating some of the grains, then drink their fill at a small lake to the east. The ground here is
      well-tilled by the moles as they dig their tunnels.
