    sight: >
      A ring of four smooth stone pyramids line a small area of cropped bluegrass. The inner side of each
      stone is entirely reflective, where any rays of the electromagnetic spectrum bounce off the highly
      polished surfaces. The light is directed toward the center of the ring, enhancing the eternal blue flame
      which burns at the heart of this shrine, streaked with enamel. The cast iron brazier upon which the fire
      rests glows red in the heat. No offerings or sacrifices are made in this holy place as only a magical
      ritual involving the human spirit can be done here.
