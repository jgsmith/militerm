    sight: >
      The Muskrats climb ever higher into these northern mountains. The trees here are shorter and look much
      more surreal, aside from their cones. Hanging from the multitudes of branches spread aside the
      forcefully shredded track you are following are pine cones the size of bee hives. The leaves are
      perfectly round and spaced on each one, forming an artistic perfection unheard of in nature. Yet this is
      not directly Mother Nature's doing, and the most noticeable thing about the defects is the wide array of
      colors of the cones - only a few are the standard brown. Differences are not limited to the pine cones,
      as shown by the trunks, where varying tendrils of thickness wind themselves like rope. Unlike a single,
      solid, wooden base like most of these trees within the Muskrats, this form of life is much more
      resilient in combating animals and the elements.
