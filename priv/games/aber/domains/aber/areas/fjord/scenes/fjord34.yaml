    sight: >
      Branches, leaves, and masses of roots protrude and block your way in all directions. Progress is made
      with effort, but at least it is a good workout. The sunlight fades as the forest floor drops down and
      the pines rise overhead further to the south and east. Black pits lie there, and a low, continuous buzz
      emanates from the eastern one. The ground becomes soggy to the south, and something sloshing around is
      heard from that pit. There is total absence of civilized animal life here, but it can be found to the
      west.
