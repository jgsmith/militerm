      Staircases lead down from this raised section of pumice on all cardinal points. This is one of the
      transport devices used by the inhabitants of the volcano to leave and return from this dark world. Black
      structures stretch down wide avenues, and a distant rumbling comes from deep within the Phaylax Volcano.
      The air is totally deadly to human life with its near total sulfur and phosphorus content. Murmurs from
      adjoining streets float through the toxic soup.
