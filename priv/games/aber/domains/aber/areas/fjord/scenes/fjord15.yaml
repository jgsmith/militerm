      This is where the flotsam of the lake generally end up, as does most litter from picnickers. Some
      fragments of faded red cloth from an old towel and oxidized links from a now defunct suit of chain mail
      lay partially buried by the sand. Many discarded sand dollar shells, broken and splintered, dot the area
      as well. A long, thick pine tree blocks any further progress to the southerly directions. It was
      deliberately placed here to form a &+ydam&* centuries ago and has petrified since; the rocky minerals
      sparkle like quartz. The sand here is dirtier because of the strewn mess.
