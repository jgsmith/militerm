      Inside this house is an impossibly long table, since Dendine the magician keeps her secrets turned on in
      her personal life as well as her professional. Pinned tightly on one wall rests an astrological chart of
      the divine winds, but the divine spirits have never invested their power in the signs of the sky, so at
      best she can perform parlor tricks in this department. A wall rack of magic wands of different lengths
      rests against a series of shelves which hold all manners of small animated clay figures. An unusual
      assortment of beak-snapping umbrella stands in a back corner.
