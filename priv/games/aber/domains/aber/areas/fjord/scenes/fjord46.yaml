    short: Entrance to Snow-Capped Peaks
    sight: >
      The path here heads in-between the sides of two small peaks ringed with clouds and drops away below into
      an eternity of switchbacks. Somewhere in the maze of these rarely explored peaks stands the highest
      volcano in the northern regions of the continent. Mount Phaylax is never visible at any time of year and
      can be reached only by this trail. Few travelers have ever bothered to go there as it is rumored to
      house things which are alive even though the volcano itself is very much extinct.
