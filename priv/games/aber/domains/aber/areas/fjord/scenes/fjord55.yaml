    sight: >
      The basin housing the volcano to the north stretches away to the north and south. It is filled with
      quite a lot of snow, some places reaching as much as twenty feet deep. Fortunately, most of the pack is
      somewhat solid and enchanced in strength by the surface layers of ice. Wandering aimlessly through the
      caldera are many shades of the underworld, stark against the snow and looking for bodies to drain
      life-force from. Cold temperatures and the thin air here have prevented many of the corpses from
      decomposing, and some faces are forever frozen in ice, shock, and pain. At least they didn't suffer long
      as their spirits were sent to join the army of roamers here. A outcropping of pumice marks the start of
      a trail up the topmost slopes of the volcano.
