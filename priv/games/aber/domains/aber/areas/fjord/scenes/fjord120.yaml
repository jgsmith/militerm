      Deep piles of mildew fill up this sagging hole. The earth could collapse at any time, and the citizens
      of Kyerstarn would be greatly appreciative of that fact. A pile of wood thrown in corner seems to be
      composed mainly of rotting ship timbers, school desks, chairs which have just completely fallen apart,
      and some planks from a house that collapsed on the edge of the village last week. Mud splatters from the
      room occasionally into an equally muddy pool of water on the floor of this earthen conclave.
