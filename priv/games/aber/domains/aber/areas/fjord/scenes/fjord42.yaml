    sight: >
      The line of Muskrat pine marking the edge of the forest follows a straight horizontal strip of small
      boulders here at seventy-five hundred feet up from sea level. The partly cloudy sky seems much closer
      without the cover of the forest of the mountain range's own minor cloud cover, allowing a lot of
      ultraviolet light to be caught at this altitude. A constant, sometimes gusty, wind blows across the
      yellowing grasses of the mountainside, taking loose soil and making many small dust devils. Past the
      boulders to the north is a small path which zigs-zags up the mountain, while the Muskrats lead down and
      to the south. This is also an area of few remaining forms of vegetation.
