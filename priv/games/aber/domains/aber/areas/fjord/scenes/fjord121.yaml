      Branches covered in countless number of pine needles manage to block out most of the sun, providing a
      rather slittd view of the giant ball of gas, The lichen which covers the base of nearly all the trees in
      the Muskrat forest is not present at this height, so the bark is more resilient as it has a chance to
      grow. On one limb, several branches have interlocked to form a sturdy &+ycradle&*. Birds chirp in
      annoyance as their nests are invaded by an unexpected traveler, yet remain in their nests to protect
      their young.
