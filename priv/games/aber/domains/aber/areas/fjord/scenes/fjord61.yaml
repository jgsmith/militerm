    sight: >
      The boat is controlled by pulling on a cord which is stretched taut across the entire lake. The wake is
      quite small traveling at such a pace, but there is good reason to be using this boat. The lake waters
      are highly acidic from the constantly spouting volcano, although not enough to cause instant dissolution
      - to boats. But with repeated use, wooden and metal boats would be eaten, and then whoever ended up
      swimming would become part of the lake rather quickly and painfully. A pier of rock is where one end of
      the rope starts, marking the shoreline and a section of the Phaylax Trail.
