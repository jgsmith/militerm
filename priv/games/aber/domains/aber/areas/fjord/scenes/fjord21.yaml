    sight: >
      The beach here has been shaped into a half-moon, letting the meadow edges grow right to the water.
      Lining this semi-circle are small rocks engraved with pictures of hands. The rocks are a true work of
      art - each pair of hands appears to be 'held' by the opposing hand of its neighbor, completing a link
      around the beach. Leading due north beyond the rocks is a pathway made out of mother-of-pearl quartz
      pebbles, which runs to a halt between two towering pyramids of smooth stone. The lake stretches away to
      the south.
