    sight: >
      A puddle of water covers the bottom two inches of this sandy depression. During the early spawning
      seasons, some fish deposit their eggs here, given its natural protection from predators and proximity to
      the shore. Over time, the hole has filled in with the surrounding sand as water erodes away the sides.
      Therefore, kids who swim in the lake will dig out the hole and place their feet in the warm water - sort
      of like a miniature spa. The beach continues to wind around the lake to the north and south.
