    short: An End of the Track
    sight: >
      The deer track comes to an abrupt halt as the undergrowth merges together from all sides. The northern
      sections of this pine forest are filled with less common animals, some of which are rumored to be
      titanic beasts. Many think it an old wives' tale to allure young children into eating their vegetables,
      but there have also been unconfirmed reports of people disappearing in this area, once even an entire
      expedition. An unobstructed way through the forest is to the east, and the deer have been kind and
      methodical enough to form a path leading south, more towards the heart of the of the Muskrats. The woods
      here are darker, and the trees more towering. Usually, it is rare to find pine trees that are over
      seventy-five feet tall, but perhaps the bones of the supposedly inhabiting beasts provide certain
      minerals into the ground and act as a super-growth formula.
