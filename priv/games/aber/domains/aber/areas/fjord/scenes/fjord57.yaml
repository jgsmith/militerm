    short: Winding With the Phaylax Trail
    sight: >
      A path made of black glassy lava leads up from the caldera and winds around the mountain, terminating
      somewhere near the lip of the crater. Cutting gales sweep across the steep climb of the slope, bringing
      fine flakes of snow pelting against you. Shades stand motionless at various points on the trail, some
      simply hovering off the edge in mid-air, their formless, transparent faces staring at nothing.
