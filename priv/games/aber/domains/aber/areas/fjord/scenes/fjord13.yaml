    sight: >
      The meadow terminates at the beachline of the lake. The sand here is a glistening pinkish-orange,
      sparkling in the sunlight or moonlight. Roughly fifteen feet to the east, the crystal clear liquid of
      the lake ebbs and flows gently, where some freshwater sand dollars eke out their lives in ceaseless
      contemplation of their intertidal universe. Scitter bugs live up to their namesake as they glide along
      the surface. and small fish swim down the drop-off near the water's edge. A family of deer stand on the
      shore further to the north, sipping quietly from the lake.
