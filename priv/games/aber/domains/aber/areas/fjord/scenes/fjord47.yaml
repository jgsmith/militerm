    sight: >
      Whiteness and clouds mislead and obscure vision, respectively, as you leave a lonely trail of three-inch
      deep footprints along the trail that has become a snow-filled ditch here. The grade continues nearly
      level to the north and east, but plunges away to more sensible altitudes southward. There is the outline
      of a cave within an overhang of porous rock and thick, streaked icicles. Brief jets of warm air are
      vented from the opening.
