    sight: >
      High wind velocities rush over the upper slopes on the north side of Mount Phaylax, sending pieces of
      ash and black glassy lava all over the place. The rock-containing dust storm rages unabated at this
      altitude, allowing no respite to one who travels over it. The volcano blocks all view southward, but the
      north reveals the line of the cold northern seas and ice-covered slopes leading to it.
