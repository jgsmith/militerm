    sight: >
      The finely made trail continues north and south across untapped wilderness. Some wayward pines pock mark
      the landscape to either side as far as the eye can see. Families of animals live within the almost
      hollowed-out trunks of these trees, where the slight wind chill factor of these parts can never reach.
      Nestled among the pines stands a long abandoned hovel, its thatched roof and stone walls strongly
      defiant against the elements. The pine forest thickens to the north and stops a smile to the south
      before the pasture.
