    short: Dome of the Tower
    sight: >
      The light filtering through these walls is not cool and icy-green, but dimmer, more subdued, for you now
      stand inside a great hemisphere, banded in gold and translucent glass. The dome is warm, its floor
      striped with the sunlight that slants in through the banded roof; and yet it is a strangely gloomy
      place, bringing a heaviness to the senses. The room only holds one square table, a carved wooden screen,
      and a scattering of big high-backed chairs, as sturdy as if they were carved from solid blocks of wood.
