    sight: >
      You are in a great open city square. It is edged by pillared grey-white buildings gleaming in the
      sunlight, filled with people and music and the calls of traders at bright coloured stalls, and the
      sparkle and splash of water flung high by fountains. There is a stir in the crowd, heads turning. You
      can see a coach, its roof dark blue and splendidly decorated with gold, and blue plumes tossing before
      it from the foreheads of tall midnight-black horses. A &+Ycrest&* is engraved on the glossy door of the
      coach in gold, higher than your head.
