      You find yourself behind a balustrade of pure wrought gold, looking out over the gold and glittering
      roofs of the City and the mounded green sweep of the park, just as you did at the very beginning, but
      you are much higher up now. You see that the balcony you are on is the lower rim of a great curving
      white and golden roof, and you realise that it is this, the Empty Palace of King Gwyddno Garanhir, that
      is topped by the marvellous dome, banded in gold and crystal, that you first saw glittering in the dawn.
