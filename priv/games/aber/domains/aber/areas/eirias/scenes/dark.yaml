      A surge of darkness and fury and menace is streaming up the steps of the Tower towards you. You feel the
      Terror of the Dark's Rising. You can't take your eyes off the &+Cwheel&*, knowing that at any moment,
      the Dark could come pouring through to take what they see as rightfully theirs, Eirias!
