      You stand high up, on a golden roof, behind a low &+ylattice&* of wrought gold. Behind you, and at
      either side, stretch the roofs of a great city, gleaming spires, towers and turrets crowding the
      skyline, some as golden as the place where you stand, some dark as night. You can see, amongst the peaks
      and ridges of the roofs, a great golden dome, topped with a golden arrow pointing westwards to the blue
      horizon-line of the sea. The sides of the dome are banded with panels of crystal running between strips
      of gold.
