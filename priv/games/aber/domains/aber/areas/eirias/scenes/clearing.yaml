    sight: >
      The coach stops here, and somehow you know you have to walk the rest of the way. You get out, and look
      around you. You have come out of the forest into a country area, with a little lane continuing on
      northwards and fields all around. There is a little cottage to the west with a white maytree growing out
      of the roof.
