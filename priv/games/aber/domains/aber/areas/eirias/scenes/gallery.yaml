    sight: >
      You come up through a trapdoor, close to one end of a long gallery. The floor stretches before you in
      curious sections, one after another, on different levels, so that one might be higher than the one
      before, and the next lower than either. The place seems to be a kind of library. Heavy square tables and
      chairs fill it, separated by low stacks of bookshelves, and the wall on your left is covered entirely in
      books. The ceiling is wood-panelled. There are people throughout the room, looking at various books, but
      they don't seem to see or hear you. You look at one book a man is holding, but the title seems to be in
      a foreign language and the pages are completely blank. You walk up the length of the gallery, past all
      the people. As you turn a corner, the last section of the gallery is filled with strong light blazing in
      from whatever lies beyond.
