    sight: >
      The mead hall Heorot surrounds you. As you look south you see large wooden tables lined to the west and
      east of you. These tables are where some of the greatest warriors known to the world eat together. The
      ceiling is very high, so high that you can barely make out the paintings way up there. The floor itself
      is stone, and is covered no where in your sight. As you peer closer you notice small red spots in some
      of the stones.
