      Here at the very bottom of the mere is the home of a pure evil. Lined on the walls are the weapons of
      past warriors who tryed their luck here and lost. Suits of armor lie piled in one corner, the bones of
      their owners lie in another. What kind of creature could cause such destruction? Stay around and you
      will definitely find out.
