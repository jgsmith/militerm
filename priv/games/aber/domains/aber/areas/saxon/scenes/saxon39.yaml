    sight: >
      The mere is not a pleasant site. It is like being in a sea composed of pure blood, and having a
      blindfold on so that you can't see where you are headed. The floor of the mere is covered with bones of
      dead animals, and their solid rotting flesh. You also sense small sea-going vessels crumpled in pieces,
      no doubt that their owners went down with them.
