    sight: >
      The shadow of he huge mountain engulfs your body as you approach it. Wild brush nor tree nor weed can
      grow here, the lack of sunshine is too much of a strain. Since the sun's rays do not penetrate here, the
      temperature remains very cold at all times. The wind here blows strongly from the south, as if the
      mountain is attempting to suck you in.
