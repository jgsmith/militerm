      To the south of you lies Heorot. This is the great mead hall of the Danish people, and Hrothgar's
      present to his many warriors. The hall does not hold the mystique it once did, as the evil creature
      Grendel has many a night murdered the sleeping heroes in this hall. A sense of foreboding overwhelms you
      as you take in the site, but you still feel drawn to it.
