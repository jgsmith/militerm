      Here on the edge of the prairie lies a dying forest. As you look eastward you see nothing but drooping
      tree tops, which seem to extend out forever. Due to the fact the cover is dying, small undergrowth has
      started to grow, but will not last for long. You can descend into the forest by going east, or head west
      back to the prairie.
