      Here against the eastern walls of Heorot the floors are bare. No tables, no racks, and no carpets. This
      is the sleeping area of the warriors during the night time. They sleep here because the king's bed
      chambers lie to the south, and they must protect him at all times. Interestingly, the red spots on the
      floor are greater here than anywhere.
