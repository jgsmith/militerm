      This is Hrothgar's throne room. In each corner of the room is a suit of armor stood up to resemble a
      knight. The throne itself is raised above the floor on a platform adorned with gold. A large red carpet
      leads from the entrance of the room to the platform. On the walls are paintings of past Danish rulers,
      and of great warriors whose days have passed. Hanging on the wall behind the throne are the Danish
      colors. The only exit is back to the north.
