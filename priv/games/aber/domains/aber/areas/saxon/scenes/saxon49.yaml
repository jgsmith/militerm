    sight: >
      The trees here are singed a horrible black color. It would appear to the average eye that a raging
      forest fire came through here, but the large foot prints in the ground hint otherwise. To the north you
      notice a hole in the side of the mountain, which resembles a fireplace. Back to the south is the burning
      shanty and the forest.
