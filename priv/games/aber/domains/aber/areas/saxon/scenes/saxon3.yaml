    sight: >
      The top of the cliff is barren, no wildlife, just jagged rocks filling your view. Anything that resides
      here is an open target to be attacked as food. The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks below
      travels to your ears, and cries from circling birds raise the hair on your neck. To the south of you a
      green prairie emerges, and to the north a mountain looms in the distance.
