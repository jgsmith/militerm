    sight: >
      The land here is beautiful, trees scattered over the landscape to provide cover from the wind. Long
      flowing grasses sway in the breeze, and small animals scurry around you looking for food. It is a
      welcome contrast to the barren land north of you. On southward, a dirt road becomes visible to you.
