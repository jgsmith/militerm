      This is the bed chambers of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow. The room's walls are covered in paintings of noble
      warriors and evil dragons. The furniture is ornamented with gold, showing the wealth of this great
      kingdom. There is a fireplace in the middle of the southern wall, to help keep the stone room warm for
      the rulers. The floor is covered with large rugs, all very plush and valuable looking. To the north is
      the exit back to Heorot.
