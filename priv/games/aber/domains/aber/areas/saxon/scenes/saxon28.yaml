      The floor is covered with ice, making it hard for you to keep your balance. The ice is spotted with
      blood, and skulls lay here and there. The evil grows stronger here, and the temperature colder. Going
      west leads deeper into the cave, and climbing back out leads to the shadow of the mountain.
