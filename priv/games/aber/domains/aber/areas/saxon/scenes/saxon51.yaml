    sight: >
      The walls are pitch black, but an overpowering glow shines in from the north. There are skeletons
      scattered about of bears, deer, and some even appear to be humans. The whole sight brings to mind a
      slaughterhouse you saw when you were younger, but these bones are broken and licked clean.
