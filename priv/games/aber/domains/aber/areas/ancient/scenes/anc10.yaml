    sight: >
      You have arrived at a wide stone bridge. The bridge consists of four huge monoliths placed side by side
      over the river and pavement made of smaller flagstones quite like the others in the town. The San Juan
      river flows gently under the bridge to the east. You are considering a little refreshing dive into the
      river, but as you see all the alligators you think it might be better to take a boat.
