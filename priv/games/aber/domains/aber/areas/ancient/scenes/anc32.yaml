    sight: >
      You stand half-way to the top of the pyramid. The rising sun casts its' rays in your eyes making you
      half blind. It spreads its' mighty power over the land and its' warmth gives you the strenght needed to
      do the rest of the climb. In front of you, there's a wide doorway leading inside the pyramid. The
      stairway leads up and down.
