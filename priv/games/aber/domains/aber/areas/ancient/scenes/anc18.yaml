      Well well... Now you know what it is when you go further to the west. A number of magnum size mosquitos
      attack you buzzing madly of thirst for your blood. You feel, however, strong devotion to your liquid of
      life and decide not to give up without a fight. As you prepare yourself for the battle you quickly look
      around and notice two escape ways - one back east where the less enormous mosquitos were and one south
      to the river bank.
