      You enter a chamber decorated with paintings of great wars on the walls. The warlord earned his eternal
      home by guarding the city from the mountain tribes living south of the city. He also saved the emperor
      from assasins who tried to take his life, after the priests had predicted the devastation. The only exit
      is to the south.
