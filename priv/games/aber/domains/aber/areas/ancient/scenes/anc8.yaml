    sight: >
      Looking back down where you came from makes you feel dizzy so you decide to pay more attention to a huge
      monolith laying before you. The monolith is four feet high and twelve feet wide. Its' face is smooth,
      but covered with dark red and brown spots all over it. This is probably a place where the priests of
      this ancient city used to worship their god of Earth and the Universe later known as Quetzalcoatl by the
      Aztecs. The sight could easily turn a flesh-eating beast to a true vegetarian.
