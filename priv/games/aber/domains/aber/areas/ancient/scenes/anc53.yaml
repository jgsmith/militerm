      The emperors' chief astronomer walks these underground caverns. She was the first one to notice the
      signs of destruction on the sky years ago. Signs of her wisdom and skill can still be found in the
      deserted town. There are calendars and large astronomical maps covering the walls. Surprisingly you find
      your birthday on the calendar - and the day of your death! The only way out is to the west.
