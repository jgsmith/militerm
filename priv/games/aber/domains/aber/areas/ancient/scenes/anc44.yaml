    sight: >
      You decided to choose the alligators. Quicky you clamber to the jetty and prepare yourself for the
      battle. The alligators, however, start preparing themselves for dinner. They obviously liked your
      decision which makes you think that maybe it would have been a better idea to go further east along the
      river despite the rapid. To the north you see a little sanctuary.
