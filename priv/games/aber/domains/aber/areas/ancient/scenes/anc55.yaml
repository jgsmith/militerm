      The natives might like snakes and even worship them, but the snake living in this dim cellar doesn't
      much like you. Its' presence reminds you about your mortality and makes you consider whether to leave at
      once or try to slay that rattling thing before you. You suddenly notice that the floor is covered with
      gold items and your natural greed makes you consider the the matter even harder. The snake, however, is
      guarding these valuables so you can't just take them and leave. It might already be too late to escape
      back up.
