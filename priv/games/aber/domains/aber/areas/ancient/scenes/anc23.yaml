      You leave the huge sun pyramid behind your back and head to the at least as big moon pyramid to the
      north. The pyramids' mighty figure rises up to the northers sky hiding the big emmental behind its'
      shape. You still have a long walk to do to reach the pyramid. The street leads north and south.
