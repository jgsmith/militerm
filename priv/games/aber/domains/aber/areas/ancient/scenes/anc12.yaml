    sight: >
      Your small boat floats slowly along the river. You notice a slight increase in the speed the river
      flows. You look at the river bank to find a nice calm place to get ashore. The shore, however, is
      crowded by alligators and you find it quite forbidding. You have to choose whether to keep going further
      east or back west to the bridge.
