    short: Stairway to the Moon
    sight: >
      The stairs seem endless and you are breathing heavily, wishing you were in better condition. You glance
      up and it almost looks like you were much closer to the moon than just a moment ago. You wipe away the
      sweat on your forehead and keep climbing up the stairs.
