    sight: >
      The river flows quite fast and you have to make a decision quickly between the river and the alligators.
      You are breathing heavily as you try to keep your boat steady. The river continues east and west. To the
      northern shore you see some sort of building. Unfortunately you have to pass by some hungry alligators
      before you can step ashore. You desperately try to remember how Crocodile Dundee did the trick.
