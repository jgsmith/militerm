    short: The Hall of the Servants
    sight: >
      You step into a less decorated room that is obviously meant to be the servants' accomodation. There's a
      table before the back wall and a lamp brings light into this otherwise dim chamber. By studying the
      pictures on the floor, you find out that most of the slaves and servants were killed when the upper
      class moved down underground. The ghosts of these poor people still wander these lands of blood. To
      prevent the ghosts from entering the underground town many guardians have been placed at the entrance.
      The only exit is to the east.
