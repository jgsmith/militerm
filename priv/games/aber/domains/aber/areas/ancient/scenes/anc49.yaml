    sight: >
      You feel strong magical powers surrounding you as you enter this room. The story tells that there was a
      disc of the mighty Sun God originally placed on top of the huge sun pyramid by the sun god himself.
      After the messages about the destruction were received, the priests had a holy stone and a feather of
      the sacred Quetzalbird, brought from a hermit living at the Tropic of Cancer to move this holy item.
