    sight: >
      The walls of the room are covered with brightly colored fresco murals from floor to ceiling,.. and onto
      the ceiling too. A man whose face reminds you of some canyon lanscapes you have seen sits on his
      haunches staring at you. It seems like he might have a lot to teach you. Try "learn info" to see if you
      can afford his fees.
