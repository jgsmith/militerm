    short: Moist Tunnel
    sight: >
      You have discovered a moist dark passageway that disappears under the great sun pyramid. The air inside
      this narrow tunnel is stuffy and you seriously consider whether you should go further or not. The tunnel
      continues to the east. To the south you see a narrow crack which makes you once again think about losing
      weight to make it easier to move between those rugged stone walls.
