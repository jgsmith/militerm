    sight: >
      You find yourself on the edge of a vast mountain range. To the east you can see a large square-shaped
      clearing. Further east you can see some kind of a temple while on the north-east on the edge of you
      sight lies two pyramid- shaped buildings. Despite the strange looking buildings you find the eastward
      path more inviting than the high mountains to the west.
