    sight: >
      Your heart beats fast and you stop for a while to breath deep and recover from the battle with the
      alligators. You have an odd feeling that Mr Dundee didn't have so much trouble with the gators. You wipe
      the sweat from your forehead and look around. You find yourself in a small room sanctified to some god
      of these unknown people. On the north wall there stands a small &+ybronze statue&* decorated with
      colorful stones. The statue stands firmly on the floor and it's almost impossible to move. The stone
      decorations, however, seem to be quite loose on the statue. Maybe you still can bring something home to
      your sweetheart from your adventures - if you survive, that is.
