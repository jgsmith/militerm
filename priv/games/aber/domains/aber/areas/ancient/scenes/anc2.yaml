    sight: >
      You are standing on a large square-shaped clearing. Pieces of old weapons and arrowheads on the ground
      tell you that the grass over here has once been manured with blood. Nearby to the north you see the San
      Juan river. Passages lead west towards a mountain range and east to a some kind of a street.
