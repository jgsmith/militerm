      The wisdom of the universe has been collected on the shelves of this room in the form of old &+Cbooks&*,
      written centuries ago by wizards and mages who reigned these, now so desolated, lands. The books have
      been written in some unknown language so you can't share the wisdom with those wizards who died a long
      time ago. The owner of the &+Cbooks&*, however, seems not to have this problem for the books look as if
      they have been read through thousands of times during the preceding centuries.
