    short: Large Square
    sight: >
      You have arrived at a large square. In the middle you see three twenty feel long monoliths around a
      small stone table guarding it from intruders. To the north a stony stairway leads up the side of the
      moon pyramid. To the east and west there are several small buildings and the street leads southwards
      back to where you came from.
