    short: Room of the Lost Hope
    sight: >
      You see pieces of old bleached bones covering the ground. Hundreds of cockroaches have occupied a
      skeleton of some poor adventurer in the corner. Even though this is a miserable sight you are still
      wondering, why is this place called the room of the lost hope...
