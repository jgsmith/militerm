    sight: >
      This is the north part of the monastery ossarium. Deep niches have been dug in the walls to store large
      piles of skulls and bones. Bones in neat piles fill the parts of the floor that isn't covered in mud. A
      sudden chilly draft makes you jump and you can feel your heart beat in a faster pace. A narrow
      passageway goes up towards the west, and to the south the ossarium continues.
