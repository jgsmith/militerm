      You have entered a monk's cell. There is a straw bed along one wall and a table and chair on the
      opposite wall. Unlike the other cells in this dormitory this one seems to radiate truth, goodness, and
      knowledge. There are scraps of parchment neatly stacked on the table. There are feather quills bundled
      neatly next to them. There is a door to the east.
