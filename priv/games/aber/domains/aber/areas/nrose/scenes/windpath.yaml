      You are on a winding path which climbs up to what appears from your position to be a fortress on top of
      a hill to the east. To the north is a small village. As you approach the structure, you notice an
      opening in the walls and move yourself toward it. The opening now appears to be an archway with a
      portcullis. Chiselled into the arch are these words, "NOMINE ROSAE", evidently the name of this place.
