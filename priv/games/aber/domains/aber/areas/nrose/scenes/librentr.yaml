      You have found the fabled library of this monastery. Inside it are thousands of hand-printed,
      leather-bound books and ancient silk-encased scrolls. In here is incredible knowledge: the magic and
      wisdom of the Arabs, the philosophy and science of the Greeks, the great histories and poetry of the
      Romans, and the forbidden theology of the great heretics.
