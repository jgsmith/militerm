      You are in the monk's bath house. Along one wall are many wooden tubs with curtains around them that
      afford the monk's some privacy when they bathe. The bath house appears to be clean and tidy, but you
      can't help notice a strong musty smell that only adds to the dreary feeling you get at this monastery.
