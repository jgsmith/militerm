      Ready to play some word games? Scrabble? Boggle? Anagrams? Maybe something else? Rules are simple. Push
      the button and the tiles are sent everywhere at random. The runners must find some tiles and make the
      highest scoring word they can. This contest can be run anytime, either during regular running or a
      tournament. You can reshuffle the tiles anytime, but don't do it so you mess up someone. If you just
      want to play among the wizards normally, the host here will mix them up for you.
