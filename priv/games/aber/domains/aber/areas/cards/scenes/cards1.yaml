    short: &+MThe Deck of Cards
    sight: >
      Ready to play a card game? Poker? Blackjack? Maybe something else? Rules are simple. Push the button and
      the cards are sent everywhere at random. The runners must find enough cards to make the best hand. If
      they don't like the cards they got, they can get rid of them somewhere to prevent someone else from
      getting a better hand than you. This contest can be run anytime, either during regular running or a
      tournament. You can reshuffle anytime, but don't do it so you mess up someone. If you just want to play
      among the wizards normally, the dealer here will mix them up for you.
