    sight: >
      You are crawling through a very small hole under the throne. This is the King's escape passage for times
      of war when there is no hope left for this castle and he must flee. You notice that the passage seems to
      have been used heavily but you don't remember any wars in the area for centuries. To the west the
      passage widens.
