    sight: >
      You are enshrouded by shadows as you enter a long and wide tunnel. High on the walls you notice little
      slits cut into the stone and above you can see large holes. To the north the tunnel opens up into a
      large courtyard and to the south you can just make out the structure of the castle's huge main gates.
