The @su command lets you escalate your privileges by taking on the aspects of
a group you are in. These privileges are regardless of which character you are
playing. They are based on your account.

By requiring this escalation, you don't accidentally use a privileged command
when you don't want to.

Use the @unsu command to remove a group or all groups.
