# The sentient trait is for those entities that need to act as if they are
# aware of their environment and can respond with speech or other actions
# that are typical of humans.
#
# Note that this is used by NPCs and player characters, so this is not where
# we put auto-responses or other actions that would be confusing if done by
# players.
